<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>The study of the origin and history of popular customs
and beliefs affords an insight, otherwise unattainable,
into the operations of the human mind in early
times. Superstitions, however trivial in themselves,
relics of paganism though they be, and oftentimes comparable
to baneful weeds, are now considered proper
subjects for scientific research. While the ignorant
savage is a slave to many superstitious fancies which
dominate his every action, the educated man strives to
be free from such a bondage, yet recognizes as profitable
the study of those same beliefs. The heterogeneous
character of the material drawn from so many
sources has rendered it difficult, if not impossible, to
follow any distinctly systematic treatment of the subject.
However, the development in recent years of
a widespread interest in all branches of folk-lore warrants
the hope that any volume devoted to this subject,
and representing somewhat diligent research, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
have a certain value, in spite of its imperfections. The
expert folk-lorist may find much to criticise; but this
book, treating of popular beliefs, is intended for popular
reading. It has been the writer’s aim to make the
chapter on the Horse-Shoe as exhaustive as possible,
as this attractive symbol of superstition does not appear
to have received hitherto the attention which it merits.
This chapter is the outgrowth of a paper read at the
seventh annual meeting of the American Folk-Lore
Society, at Philadelphia, December 28, 1895, an abstract
of which appeared in the Society’s Journal for
December, 1896.</p>

<h3>I. HISTORY OF THE HORSE-SHOE</h3>

<p>The evolution of the modern horse-shoe from the
primitive foot-gear for draught animals used in ancient
times furnishes an interesting subject for investigation.
Xenophon and other historians recommended various
processes for hardening and strengthening the hoofs of
horses and mules,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and from this negative evidence
some writers have inferred that the ancients were ignorant
of farriery. It seems indeed certain that the
practice of protecting the feet of horses was not universal
among the Greeks and Romans. Fabretti, an
Italian antiquary, examined with care the representations
of horses on many ancient columns and marbles,
and found but one instance in which the horse appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
to be shod;<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and in most specimens of ancient art the
iron horse-shoe is conspicuous by its absence. But in
the mosaic portraying the battle of Issus, which was
unearthed at Pompeii in 1831, and which is now in the
Naples Museum, is the figure of a horse whose feet
appear to be shod with iron shoes similar to those in
modern use;<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and in an ancient Finnish incantation
against the plague, quoted in Lenormant’s “Chaldean
Magic and Sorcery,” occur these lines:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>O Scourge depart; Plague, take thy flight … I will give
thee a horse with which to escape, whose shoes shall not slide
on ice, nor whose feet slip on the rocks.</p>

</div>

<p>No allusion to the horse-shoe is made by early writers
on veterinary topics. But, on the other hand, there is
abundant testimony that the ancients did sometimes
protect the feet of their beasts of burden. Winckelmann,
the Prussian art historian, describes an antique
engraved stone representing a man holding up a horse’s
foot, while an assistant, kneeling, fastens on a shoe.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
In the works of the Roman poet Catullus occurs the
simile of the iron shoe of a mule sticking in the mire.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Contemporary historians relate that the Emperor Nero
caused his mules to be shod with silver,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> while golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
shoes adorned the feet of the mules belonging to the
notorious Empress Poppæa.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Mention of an iron horse-shoe
is made by Appian,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> a writer not indeed remarkable
for accuracy; but the phrase “brasen-footed
steeds,” which occurs in Homer’s Iliad, is regarded by
commentators as a metaphorical expression for strength
and endurance. Wrappings of plaited fibre, as hemp
or broom, were used by the ancients to protect the feet
of horses.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> But the most common form of foot covering
for animals appears to have been a kind of leathern
sock or sandal, which was sometimes provided with an
iron sole. This covering was fastened around the fetlocks
by means of thongs, and could be easily removed.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Iron horse-shoes of peculiar form, which have been
exhumed in Great Britain of recent years, have been
objects of much interest to archæologists. In 1878 a
number of such relics shaped for the hoof and pierced
for nails were found at a place called Cæsar’s Camp,
near Folkstone, England.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> In the south of Scotland,
also, ancient horse-shoes have been found, consisting of
a solid piece of iron made to cover the whole hoof and
very heavy. In the year 1653 a piece of iron resembling
a horse-shoe, and having nine nail-holes, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
found in the grave of Childeric I., king of the Franks,
who died <span class="smcapuc">A. D.</span> 481. Professor N. S. Shaler believes
that the iron horse-shoe was invented in the fourth
century, and from the fact that it was first called
<i>selene</i>, the moon, from its somewhat crescent-like shape,
he concludes that it originated in Greece.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> But even
in the ninth century, in France, horses were shod with
iron on special occasions only,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and the early Britons,
Saxons, and Danes do not appear to have had much
knowledge of farriery. The modern art of shoeing
horses is thought to have been generally introduced in
England by the Normans under William the Conqueror.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
Henry de Ferrars, who accompanied that
monarch, is believed to have received his surname
because he was intrusted with the inspection of the
farriers; and the coat-of-arms of his descendants still
bears six horse-shoes.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>On the gate of Oakham Castle, an ancient Norman
mansion in Rutlandshire, built by Wakelin de
Ferrars, son of the first earl of that name, were formerly
to be seen a number of horse-shoes of different
patterns.</p>

<p>The estate is famous on account of the tenure of the
barons occupying it. Every nobleman who journeyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
through its precincts was obliged as an act of homage
to forfeit a shoe of the horse whereon he rode, or else
to redeem it with a sum of money; and the horse-shoes
thus obtained were nailed upon the gate, but are now
within on the walls of the castle.</p>

<p>These walls are covered by memorials of royal personages
and peers, who have thus paid tribute to the
custom of the county.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth was thought to have initiated this
practice, though this opinion is incorrect. According
to tradition she was once journeying on a visit to her
lord high treasurer, William Cecil, the well-known
Lord Burleigh, at his residence near Stamford. While
passing through Oakham her horse is said to have cast
a shoe, and in memory of the mishap the queen ordered
a large iron shoe to be made and hung up in the castle,
and that every nobleman traveling through the town
should follow her example.</p>

<p>A similar usage prevails to-day, new shoes being provided
of shapes and sizes chosen by the donors.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>While John of Gaunt (1339-99), son of Edward
III. of England, was riding through the town of
Lancaster, his horse cast a shoe, which was kept as
a souvenir by the townspeople, and fastened in the
middle of the street. And in accordance with a time-honored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
custom a new shoe is placed in the same spot
every seven years by the residents of Horse-Shoe
Corner.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The practical value of the horse-shoe is tersely expressed
in the old German saying, “A nail preserves a
country;” for the nail keeps in place the horse-shoe,
the shoe protects the foot of the horse, the horse carries
the knight, the knight holds the castle, and the
castle defends the country.</p>

<p>The following story from Grimm’s “Household Tales”
(vol. ii. p. 303) may be appropriate in this place, as
illustrating the same idea, besides pointing a moral.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><i>The Nail.</i></p>

<p>A merchant had done a good business at the fair; he had
sold his wares and lined his money-bags with gold and silver.
Then he wanted to travel homeward and be in his house before
nightfall. So he packed his trunk with the money on
his horse and rode away. At noon he rested in a town, and
when he wanted to go farther the stable-boy brought out his
horse and said: “A nail is wanting, sir, in the shoe of its left
hind foot.” “Let it be wanting,” answered the merchant;
“the shoe will certainly stay on for the six miles I have still
to go; I am in a hurry.” In the afternoon, when he once
more alighted and had his horse fed, the stable-boy went to
him and said, “Sir, a shoe is missing from your horse’s left
hind foot; shall I take him to the blacksmith?” “Let it
still be wanting,” answered the man, “the horse can very well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
hold out for the couple of miles which remain; I am in
haste.” He rode forth, but before long the horse began to
limp. It had not limped long before it began to stumble,
and it had not stumbled long before it fell down and broke
its leg. The merchant was forced to leave the horse where it
was, and unbuckle the trunk, take it on his back, and go
home on foot. And there he did not arrive until quite late at
night. “And that unlucky nail,” said he to himself, “has
caused all this disaster.” Hasten slowly.</p>

</div>

<h3>II. THE HORSE-SHOE AS A SAFEGUARD</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Your wife’s a witch, man; you should nail a horse-shoe on your
chamber-door.—<span class="smcap">Sir Walter Scott</span>, <cite>Redgauntlet</cite>.</p>

</div>

<p>As a practical device for the protection of horses’
feet, the utility of the iron horse-shoe has long been
generally recognized; and for centuries, in countries
widely separated, it has also been popularly used as a
talisman for the preservation of buildings or premises
from the wiles of witches and fiends.</p>

<p>To the student of folk-lore, a superstition like this,
which has exerted so wide an influence over men’s
minds in the past, and which is also universally prevalent
in our own times, must have a peculiar interest.
What, then, were the reasons for the general adoption
of the horse-shoe as a talisman? It is our purpose to
consider the various theories <i lang="la">seriatim</i>.</p>

<p>Among the Romans there prevailed a custom of driving
nails into cottage walls as an antidote against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
plague. Both this practice and the later one of nailing
up horse-shoes have been thought by some to
originate from the rite of the Passover. The blood
sprinkled upon the door-posts and lintel at the time
of the great Jewish feast formed the chief points of
an arch, and it may be that with this in mind people
adopted the horse-shoe as an arch-shaped talisman,
and it thus became generally emblematic of good
luck.</p>

<p>The same thought may underlie the practice of the
peasants in the west of Scotland, who train the boughs
of the rowan or mountain-ash tree in the form of an
arch over a farmyard gate to protect their cattle from
evil.</p>

<h3>III. HORNS AND OTHER TWO-PRONGED OBJECTS</h3>

<p>The supernatural qualities of the horse-shoe as a
preservative against imaginary demons have been supposed
to be due to its bifurcated shape, as any object
having two prongs or forks was formerly thought to
be effective for this purpose. As with the crescent,
the source of this belief is doubtless the appearance of
the moon in certain of its phases.</p>

<p>Hence, according to some authorities, is derived the
alleged efficacy as amulets of horse-shoes, the horns
and tusks of animals, the talons of birds, and the
claws of wild beasts, lobsters, and crabs. Hence, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the significance of the oft-quoted lines from Robert
Herrick’s “Hesperides:”—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Hang up hooks and sheers to scare</div>
<div class="verse">Hence, the hag that rides the mare.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The horn of the fabulous unicorn, in reality none
other than that of the rhinoceros, is much valued as
an amulet, and in west Africa, where the horns of
wild animals are greatly esteemed as fiend-scarers, a
large horn filled with mud and having three small
horns attached to its lower end is used as a safeguard
to prevent slaves from running away.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>In the vicinity of Mirzapur in central Hindostan the
Horwas tie on the necks of their children the roots
of jungle plants as protective charms; their efficacy
being thought to depend on their resemblance to the
horns of certain wild beasts.</p>

<p>The Mohammedans of northern India use a complex
amulet, composed in part of a tiger’s claw and two
claws of the large-horned owl with the tips facing outward,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
while in southern Europe we find the necks of
mules ornamented with two boar’s tusks or with the
horns of an antelope.</p>

<p>Amulets fashioned in the shape of horns and
crescents are very popular among the Neapolitans.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Elworthy quotes at some length from the “Mimica
degli antichi” of Andrea de Jorio (Napoli, 1832), in
illustration of this fact. From this source we learn
that the horns of Sicilian oxen and of bullocks are in
favor with the nobility and aristocracy as evil-eye
protectives, and are frequently seen on their houses
and in their gardens; stag’s antlers are the favorites
with grocers and chemists, while the lower classes are
content with the horns of rams and goats. The
Sicilians are wont to tie pieces of red ribbon to the
little horns which they wear as charms, and this is supposed
vastly to increase their efficiency.</p>

<p>In southern Spain, particularly in Andalusia, the
stag’s horn is a very favorite talisman. The native
children wear a silver-tipped horn suspended from the
neck by a braided cord made from the hair of a black
mare’s tail. It is believed that an evil glance directed
at the child is received by the horn, which thereupon
breaks asunder, and the malevolent influence is thus
dissipated.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Among the Arabs the horn amulet is believed to
render inert the malign glance of an enemy, and in
the oases of the desert the horned heads of cattle are
to be seen over the doors of the Arab dwellings as
talismans.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>In Lesbos the skulls of oxen or other horned creatures
are fixed upon trees or sticks to avert the evil eye
from the crops and fruits.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>In Mongolia the horns of antelopes are prized on
account of their alleged magical properties; fortune-tellers
and diviners affect to derive a knowledge of
futurity by observation of the rings which encircle
them. The Mongols set a high value upon whip-handles
made from these horns, and aver that their use
by horsemen promotes endurance in their steeds.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Inasmuch as the horns of animals serve as weapons
both for attack and defense, they were early associated
in men’s minds with the idea of power. Thus in
ancient times the corners of altars were fashioned in
the shape of horns, doubtless in order to symbolize the
majesty and power of the Being in whose honor sacrifices
were offered.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Apropos of horns as symbols of strength, the
peasants of Bannú, a district of the Punjab, believe
that God placed the newly created world upon a cow’s
horn, the cow on a fish’s back, and the fish on a stone;
but what the stone rests upon, they do not venture to
surmise. According to their theory, whenever the cow
shakes her head, an earthquake naturally results.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>The Siamese attribute therapeutic qualities to the
horns and tusks of certain animals, and their pharmacopœia
contains a somewhat complex prescription
used as a febrifuge, whose principal ingredients are
the powdered horns of a rhinoceros, bison, and stag,
the tusks of an elephant and tiger, and the teeth
of a bear and crocodile. These are mixed together
with water, and half of the resulting compound is to
be swallowed, the remainder to be rubbed upon the
body.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>The <i lang="it">mano cornuta</i> or anti-witch gesture is used very
generally in southern and central Italy. Its antiquity
is vouched for by its representation in ancient paintings
unearthed at Pompeii.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> It consists in flexing the
two middle fingers, while the others are extended in
imitation of horns. When the hand in this position is
pointed at an obnoxious individual, the malignity of his
glance is believed to be rendered inert.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>In F. Marion Crawford’s novel, “Pietro Ghisleri,”
one of the characters, Laura Arden, was regarded in
Roman society as a <i lang="it">jettatrice</i>, that is, one having the
evil eye. Such a reputation once fastened on a person
involves social ostracism. In the presence of the unfortunate
individual every hand was hidden to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the talismanic gesture, and at the mere mention of her
name all Rome “made horns.” No one ever accosted
her without having the fingers flexed in the approved
fashion, unless, indeed, they had about them some
potent amulet.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that the possession of the evil
eye may be imputed to any one, regardless of character
or position. Pope Pius IX. was believed to have this
malevolent power, and many devout Christians, while
on their knees awaiting his benediction, were accustomed
slyly to extend a hand toward him in the above-mentioned
position.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>In an article on “Asiatic Symbolism” in the “Indian
Antiquary” (vol. xv. 1886), Mr. H. G. M. Murray-Aynsley
says, in regard to Neapolitan evil-eye amulets,
that they were probably introduced in southern Italy
by Greek colonists of Asiatic ancestry, who settled
at Cumæ and other places in that neighborhood.
Whether fashioned in the shape of horns or crescents,
they are survivals of an ancient Chaldean symbol. It
has been said that nothing, unless perhaps a superstitious
belief, is more easily transmissible than a symbol;
and the people of antiquity were wont to attribute to
every symbol a talismanic value.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>The modern Greeks, as well as the Italians, wear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
little charms representing the hand as making this
gesture.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>But not alone in the south of Europe exists the
belief in the peculiar virtues of two-pronged objects,
for in Norway reindeer-horns are placed over the doors
of farm-buildings to drive off demons;<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and the fine
antlers which grace the homes of successful hunters in
our own country are doubtless often regarded by their
owners as of more value than mere trophies of the
chase, inasmuch as traditional fancy invests them with
such extraordinary virtues.</p>

<p>In France a piece of stag-horn is thought to be a
preservative against witchcraft and disease, while in
Portugal ox-horns fastened on poles are placed in
melon-patches to protect the fruit from withering
glances.</p>

<p>Among the Ossetes, a tribe of the Caucasus, the
women arrange their hair in the shape of a chamois-horn,
curving forwards over the brow, thus forming a
talismanic coiffure; and when a Moslem takes his child
on a journey he paints a crescent between its eyes, or
tattooes the same device on its body. The modern
Greek, too, adopts the precaution of attaching a crab’s
claw to the child’s head.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> In northern Africa the
horns of animals are very generally used as amulets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the prevailing idea being everywhere the same, namely,
that pronged objects repel demons and evil glances.</p>

<p>Horns are used in eastern countries as ornaments to
head-dresses, and serve, moreover, as symbols of rank.
They are often made of precious metals, sometimes of
wood. The <i>tantura</i>, worn by the Druses of Mount
Lebanon in Syria, has this shape.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>In the Bulgarian villages of Macedonia and Thrace
the so-called wise woman, who combines the professions
of witch and midwife, is an important character. Immediately
upon the birth of a child this personage
places a reaping-hook in a corner of the room to keep
away unfriendly spirits; the efficacy of the talisman
being doubtless due partly to its shape, which bears
considerable resemblance to a horse-shoe.</p>

<p>And in Albania, a sickle, with which straw has just
been cut, is placed for a few seconds on the stomach of
a newly born child to prevent the demons who cause
colic from exercising their functions.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>The mystic virtue of the forked shape is not, however,
restricted to its faculty of averting the glance of
an evil eye or other malign influences, for the Divining
Rod is believed to derive from this same peculiarity of
form its magical power of detecting the presence of
water or metals when wielded by an experienced hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<h3>IV. THE SYMBOL OF THE OPEN HAND</h3>

<p>It is worthy of note that the symbol of an open hand
with extended fingers was a favorite talisman in former
ages, and was to be seen, for example, at the entrances
of dwellings in ancient Carthage. It is also found
on Lybian and Phœnician tombs, as well as on Celtic
monuments in French Brittany.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Dr. H. C. Trumbull
quotes evidence from various writers showing that this
symbol is in common use at the present time in several
Eastern lands. In the region of ancient Babylonia the
figure of a red outstretched hand is still displayed on
houses and animals; and in Jerusalem the same token
is frequently placed above the door or on the lintel on
account of its reputed virtues in averting evil glances.
The Spanish Jews of Jerusalem draw the figure of a
hand in red upon the doors of their houses; and they
also place upon their children’s heads silver hand-shaped
charms, which they believe to be specially obnoxious
to unfriendly individuals desirous of bringing
evil either upon the children themselves, or upon other
members of the household.</p>

<p>In different parts of Palestine the open-hand symbol
appears alike on the houses of Christians, Jews, and
Moslems, usually painted in blue on or above the door.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Claude Reignier Conder, R. E., in “Heth and Moab,”
remarks on the antiquity of this pagan emblem, which
appears on Roman standards and on the sceptre of Siva
in India. He is of the opinion that the figure of the
red hand, whether sculptured on Irish crosses, displayed
in Indian temples, or on Mexican buildings, is always
an example of the same original idea,—that of a protective
symbol.</p>

<p>A white hand-print is commonly seen upon the doors
and shutters of Jewish and Moslem houses in Beyrout
and other Syrian towns; and even the Christian residents
of these towns sometimes mark windows and
flour-boxes with this emblem, after dipping the hand in
whitewash, in order to “avert chilling February winds
from old people and to bring luck to the bin.”<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>In Germany a rude amulet having the form of an
open hand is fashioned out of the stems of coarse
plants, and is deemed an ample safeguard against divers
misfortunes and sorceries. It is called “the hand of
Saint John,” or “the hand of Fortune.”</p>

<p>The Jewish matrons of Algeria fasten little golden
hands to their children’s caps, or to their glass-bead
necklaces, and they themselves carry about similar luck
tokens.</p>

<p>In northwestern Scotland whoever enters a house
where butter is being made is expected to lay his hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
upon the churn, thereby signifying that he has no evil
designs against the butter-maker, and dissipating any
possible effects of an evil eye.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>As a charm against malevolent influences, the Arabs
of Algeria make use of rude drawings representing an
open hand, placed either above the entrances of their
habitations or within doors,—a symbolical translation
of the well-known Arabic imprecation, “Five fingers in
thine eye!” Oftentimes the same meaning is conveyed
by five lines, one shorter than the others to indicate
the thumb, thus <img class="inline" src="images/symbol.jpg" width="40" height="44" alt="(drawing of the symbol described)" />.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<h3>V. CRESCENTS AND HALF-MOON-SHAPED AMULETS</h3>

<p>The alleged predominant influence of the moon’s
wax and wane over the growth and welfare of vegetation
was formerly generally recognized. Thus in an
almanac of the year 1661 it is stated that:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If any corn, seed, or plant be either set or sown within six
hours either before or after the full Moon in Summer, or
before the new Moon in Winter, having joined with the cosmical
rising of Arcturus and Orion, the Hædi and the Siculi,
it is subject to blasting and canker.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Timber was always cut during the wane of the
moon, and so firmly rooted was this superstition that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
directions were given accordingly in the Forest Code
of France.</p>

<p>An early English almanac advised farmers to kill
hogs when the moon was growing, as thus “the bacon
would prove the better in boiling.”</p>

<p>Even at the present time a host of credulities regarding
the moon is prevalent among the ignorant classes
of different lands. Thus, for example, the negroes in
the vicinity of Washington, D. C., believe that potatoes
should be planted before the new moon in order to
thrive, and among the negroes and Indians of the
State of Missouri, the proper time for weaning a baby
or calf is determined by the lunar phases.</p>

<p>Moon-worship was one of the most ancient forms of
idolatry, and still exists among some Eastern nations.
A relic of the practice is seen in some parts of Great
Britain in the custom of bowing to the new moon.</p>

<p>Astrologers regarded the moon as exerting a powerful
influence over the health and fortunes of human
beings, according to her aspect and position at the
time of their birth. Thus in a “Manual of Astrology”
by Raphael (London, 1828), she is described as a “cold,
moist, watery, phlegmatic planet, and partaking of good
or evil as she is aspected by good or evil stars.”<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>The growing horned moon was thought to exert a
mysterious beneficent influence not only over many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of the operations of agriculture, but over the affairs
of every-day life as well. Hence doubtless arose the
belief in the value of crescent-shaped and cornute
objects as amulets and charms; of these the horse-shoe
is the one most commonly available, and therefore the
one most generally used.</p>

<p>In astrology the moon has indeed always been considered
the most influential of the heavenly bodies by
reason of her rapid motion and nearness to the earth;
and the astrologers of old, whether in forecasting
future events or in giving advice as to proper times
and seasons for the transaction of business affairs, first
ascertained whether or not the moon were well aspected.
This was also a cardinal point with the shrewd
magicians of later centuries. And should any one require
proof of the existence of a modern belief in lunar
influences, let him consult Zadkiel’s Almanac for the
year 1898. Therein he will find it stated that when
the sun is in benefic aspect with the moon, it is a suitable
day for asking favors, seeking employment, and
traveling for health.</p>

<p>Venus in benefic aspect with the moon is favorable
for courting, marrying, visiting friends, engaging maid-servants,
and seeking amusement.</p>

<p>Mars, for consulting surgeons and dealing with
engineers and soldiers.</p>

<p>Jupiter, for opening offices and places of business,
and for beginning new enterprises.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Saturn, for having to do with farmers, miners, and
elderly people, for buying real estate and for planting
and sowing.</p>

<p>For, says the oracle of the almanac, astrologers have
found by experience that if the above instructions are
followed, human affairs proceed smoothly.</p>

<p>In his work entitled “The Evil-Eye” (London,
1895), Mr. Frederick Thomas Elworthy calls attention
to the fact that the half-moon was often placed on the
heads of certain of the most powerful Egyptian deities,
and therefore when worn became a symbol of their worship.
Indeed, the crescent is common in the religious
symbolism not only of ancient Egypt, but also of
Assyria and India. The Hebrew maidens in the time
of the prophet Isaiah wore crescent-shaped ornaments
on their heads.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>The crescent is the well-known symbol of the Turkish
religion. According to tradition, Philip of Macedon
(<span class="smcapuc">B. C.</span> 382-336), the father of Alexander the Great,
attempted to undermine the walls of Byzantium during
a siege of the city, but the attempt was revealed to
the inhabitants by the light of a crescent moon.
Whereupon they erected a statue to Diana, and adopted
the crescent as their symbol.</p>

<p>When the Byzantine empire was overthrown by
Mohammed II., in 1453, the Turks regarded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
crescent, which was everywhere to be seen, as of favorable
import. They therefore made it their own
emblem, and it has since continued to be a distinctively
Mohammedan token.</p>

<p>In the Mussulman mind the new moon is intimately
associated with devotional acts. Its appearance is
eagerly watched for and</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The moment the eye lights on the slight thread of silver
in the western twilight, it remains fixed there, whilst prayers
of thanksgiving and praise are offered, the hands being held
up by the face, the palms upward and open, and afterwards
passed three times over the visage, the gaze still remaining
immovable.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Golden crescents of various sizes were among the
most primitive forms of money. Ancient coins frequently
bore the likenesses of popular deities or their
symbols, and of the latter the crescent appears to have
been the one most commonly employed.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> It was the
usual mint-mark of the coins of Thespia in the early
part of the fourth century <span class="smcapuc">B. C.</span>;<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> is seen on the coins
of the reigns of Augustus, Nero, and other Roman
emperors; and on the silver pieces of the time of
Hadrian is found the <i lang="la">Luna crescens</i> with seven stars.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>A crescent adorned the head of the goddess Diana<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
in her character of Hecate, or ruler of the infernal
regions.</p>

<p>Hecate was supposed to preside over enchantments,
and was also the special guardian and protectress of
houses and doors.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> The Greeks not only wore amulets
in the shape of the half moon, but placed them on the
walls of their houses as talismans;<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> and the Romans
used <i lang="la">phalĕræ</i>, metallic disks and crescents, to decorate
the foreheads and breasts of their horses.</p>

<p>Such ornaments are to be seen on the caparisons of
the horses on Trajan’s Column and on other ancient
monuments, in the collection of Roman antiquities in
the British Museum, and in mediæval paintings and
tapestries.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>In the portrayals of combats between the Romans
and Dacians on the Arch of Constantine, the trappings
of the horses of both armies are decorated with these
emblems,<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> as are also the bridle reins of a horse shown
in a French manuscript of the fifteenth century representing
“gentlefolk meeting on horseback.”<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Charms of similar shape, made of wolves’ teeth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
boars’ tusks, have been found in tumuli in different
parts of Great Britain.</p>

<p>A sepulchral stone, which is preserved among other
Gallo-Roman relics within the château of Chinon,
France, bears the effigy of a man standing upright and
clad in a large tunic with wide sleeves. Above the
figure is a crescent-shaped talisman, a symbol frequently
found in monuments of that period.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>But the use of these symbols, although so ancient, is
by no means obsolete; the brass crescent, an avowed
charm against the evil eye, is very commonly attached
to the elaborately decorated harnesses of Neapolitan
draught-horses, and is used in the East to embellish the
trappings of elephants. It is also still employed in
like manner in various parts of Europe and in the
England of to-day. In Germany small half-moon-shaped
amulets similar to the ancient μηνίσχοι or <i lang="la">lunulæ</i>
are still used against the evil eye.</p>

<p>In Sweden and Frisia, bridal ornaments for the head
and neck often represent the moon’s disk in its first
quarter; and it is customary to call out after a newly
married pair, “Increase, O Moon.”<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>Elworthy remarks that the horse-shoe, wherever used
as an amulet, is the handy conventional representative
of the crescent, and that the Buddhist crescent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
emblem is a horse-shoe with the curve pointed like a
Gothic arch.</p>

<p>The English fern called moonwort (<i lang="la">Botrychium
lunaria</i>) is thought to owe its reputed magical powers
to the crescent form of the segments of its frond.
Some writers regard it as identical with the martagon,
an herb formerly much used by sorcerers; and also
with the Italian <i lang="it">sferracavallo</i>.</p>

<p>According to the famous astrologer and herbalist,
Nicholas Culpepper, moonwort possessed certain occult
virtues, and was endowed with extraordinary attributes,
chief among them being its power of undoing locks
and of unshoeing horses. The same writer remarked
that, while some people of intelligence regarded these
notions with scorn, the popular name for moonwort
among the countryfolk was “unshoe-the-horse.”<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Du Bartas, in his “Divine Weekes,” says in reference
to this plant:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Horses that, feeding on the grassy hills, tread upon moonwort
with their hollow heels, though lately shod, at night go
barefoot home, their maister musing where their shoes become.
O moonwort! tell me where thou hid’st the smith,
hammer and pinchers, thou unshodd’st them with.</p>

</div>

<p>The horse-shoe has sometimes been identified with
the cross, and has been supposed to derive its amuletic
power from a fancied resemblance to the sacred Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
symbol. But inasmuch as it is difficult to find
any marked similarity in form between the crescent
and the cross, this theory does not appear to warrant
serious consideration.</p>

<h3>VI. IRON AS A PROTECTIVE CHARM</h3>

<p>Some writers have maintained that the luck associated
with the horse-shoe is due chiefly to the metal,
irrespective of its shape, as iron and steel are traditional
charms against malevolent spirits and goblins.
In their view, a horse-shoe is simply a piece of iron of
graceful shape and convenient form, commonly pierced
with seven nail-holes (a mystic number), and therefore
an altogether suitable talisman to be affixed to the door
of dwelling or stable in conformity with a venerable
custom sanctioned by centuries of usage. Of the
antiquity of the belief in the supernatural properties
of iron there can be no doubt.</p>

<p>Among the ancient Gauls this metal was thought to
be consecrated to the Evil Principle, and, according to
a fragment of the writings of the Egyptian historian
Manetho (about 275 <span class="smcapuc">B. C.</span>), iron was called in Egypt
the bone of Typhon, or Devil’s bone, for Typhon in the
Egyptian mythology was the personification of evil.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Pliny, in his “Natural History,” states that iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
coffin-nails affixed to the lintel of the door render the
inmates of the dwelling secure from the visitations of
nocturnal prowling spirits.</p>

<p>According to the same author, iron has valuable
attributes as a preservative against harmful witchcrafts
and sorceries, and may thus be used with advantage
both by adults and children. For this purpose it was
only necessary to trace a circle about one’s self with a
piece of the metal, or thrice to swing a sword around
one’s body. Moreover, gentle proddings with a sword
wherewith a man has been wounded were reputed to
alleviate divers aches and pains, and even iron-rust had
its own healing powers:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If a horse be shod with shoes made from a sword wherewith
a man has been slain, he will be most swift and fleet,

<p>The time-honored belief in the magical power of iron
and steel is shown in many traditions of the North.</p>

<p>A young herdswoman was once tending cattle in a
forest of Vermaland in Sweden; and the weather being
cold and wet, she carried along her tinder-box with
flint and steel, as is customary in that country. Presently
along came a giantess carrying a casket, which
she asked the girl to keep while she went away to invite
some friends to attend her daughter’s marriage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Quite thoughtlessly the girl laid her fire-steel on the
casket, and when the giantess returned for the property
she could not touch it, for steel is repellant to trolls,
both great and small. So the herdswoman carried
home the treasure-box, which was found to contain a
golden crown and other valuables.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>The heathen Northmen believed in the existence of a
race of dwarfish artisans, who were skilled in the working
of metals, and who fashioned implements of warfare
in their subterranean workshops. These dwarfs were
also thought to inhabit isolated rocks; and according to
a popular notion, if a man chanced to encounter one of
them, and quickly threw a piece of steel between him
and his habitation, he could thereby prevent the dwarf
from returning home, and could exact of him whatever
he desired.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Among French Canadians, fireflies are viewed with
superstitious eyes as luminous imps of evil, and iron and
steel are the most potent safeguards against them; a
knife or needle stuck into the nearest fence is thought
to amply protect the belated wayfarer against these insects,
for they will either do themselves injury upon the
former, or will become so exhausted in endeavoring to
pass through the needle’s eye as to render them temporarily
harmless.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Such waifs and strays of popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
credulity may seem most trivial, yet they serve to illustrate
the ancient and widely diffused belief in the traditional
qualities ascribed to certain metals.</p>

<p>One widely prevalent theory ascribed to iron a meteoric
origin, but the different nations of antiquity were
wont to attribute its discovery or invention to some
favorite deity or mythological personage; Osiris was
thus honored by the Egyptians, Vulcan by the Romans,
and Wodan or Odin by the Teutons.</p>

<p>In early times the employment of iron in the arts
was much restricted by reason of its dull exterior and
brittleness. There existed, moreover, among the Romans
a certain religious prejudice against the metal,
whose use in many ceremonies was wholly proscribed.
This prejudice appears to have been due to the fact that
iron weapons were held jointly responsible with those
who wielded them for the shedding of human blood;
inasmuch as swords, knives, battle-axes, lance and spear
points, and other implements of war were made of iron.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Those mythical demons of Oriental lands known as
the <i>Jinn</i> are believed to be exorcised by the mere name
of iron;<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and Arabs when overtaken by a simoom in the
desert endeavor to charm away these spirits of evil by
crying, “Iron, iron!”<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Jinn</i> being legendary creatures of the Stone
Age, the comparatively modern metal is supposed to be
obnoxious to them. In Scandinavia and in northern
countries generally, iron is a historic charm against the
wiles of sorcerers.</p>

<p>The Chinese sometimes wear outside of their clothing
a piece of an old iron plough-point as a charm;<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> and
they have also a custom of driving long iron nails in
certain kinds of trees to exorcise some particularly dangerous
female demons which haunt them.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The ancient
Irish were wont to hang crooked horse-shoe nails about
the necks of their children as charms;<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> and in Teutonic
folk-lore we find the venerable superstition that a horse-shoe
nail found by chance and driven into the fireplace
will effect the restoration of stolen property to the
owner. In Ireland, at the present time, iron is held to
be a sacred and luck-bringing metal which thieves hesitate
to steal.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>A Celtic legend says that the name <i>Iron-land</i> or
<i>Ireland</i> originated as follows: The Emerald Isle was
formerly altogether submerged, except during a brief
period every seventh year, and at such times repeated
attempts were made by foreigners to land on its soil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
but without success, as the advancing waves always
swallowed up the bold invaders. Finally a heavenly
revelation declared that the island could only be rescued
from the sea by throwing a piece of iron upon it
during its brief appearance above the waters. Profiting
by the information thus vouchsafed, a daring
adventurer cast his sword upon the land at the time
indicated, thereby dissolving the spell, and Ireland has
ever since remained above the water. On account of
this tradition the finding of iron is always accounted
lucky by the Irish; and when the treasure-trove has the
form of a horse-shoe, it is nailed up over the house
door. Thus iron is believed to have reclaimed Ireland
from the sea, and the talismanic symbol of its reclamation
is the iron horse-shoe.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>Once upon a time—so runs a tradition of the
Ukraine, the border region between Russia and Poland—some
men found a piece of iron. After having in
vain attempted to eat it, they tried to soften it by boiling
it in water; then they roasted it, and afterwards
beat it with stones. While thus engaged, the Devil,
who had been watching them, inquired, “What are
you making there?” and the men replied, “A hammer
with which to beat the Devil.” Thereupon Satan
asked where they had obtained the requisite sand; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
from that time men understood that sand was essential
for the use of iron-workers; and thus began the manufacture
of iron implements.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Among the Scotch fishermen also iron is invested
with magical attributes. Thus if, when plying their
vocation, one of their number chance to indulge in profanity,
the others at once call out, “Cauld airn!” and
each grasps a handy piece of the metal as a counter
influence to the misfortune which would else pursue
them throughout the day.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Even nowadays in England,
in default of a horse-shoe, the iron plates of the
heavy shoes worn by farm laborers are occasionally to
be seen fastened at the doors of their cottages.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>When in former times a belief in the existence of
mischievous elves was current in the Highland districts
of Scotland, iron and steel were in high repute as popular
safeguards against the visits of these fairy-folk;
for they were sometimes bold enough to carry off young
mothers, whom they compelled to act as wet-nurses for
their own offspring. One evening many years ago a
farmer named Ewen Macdonald, of Duldreggan, left
his wife and young infant indoors while he went out
on an errand; and tradition has it that while crossing
a brook, thereafter called in the Gaelic tongue “the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
streamlet of the knife,” he heard a strange rushing
sound accompanied with a sigh, and realized at once
that fairies were carrying off his wife. Instantly throwing
a knife into the air in the name of the Trinity, the
fairies’ power was annulled, and his wife dropped down
before him.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>In Scandinavian and Scottish folk-lore, there is a
marked affinity between iron and flint. The elf-bolt or
flint arrowhead was formerly in great repute as a charm
against divers evil influences, whether carried around
as an amulet, used as a magical purifier of drinking-water
for cattle, or to avert fairy spite. It seems possible
that iron and steel in superseding flint, which was
so useful a material in the rude arts of primitive peoples,
inherited its ancient magical qualities.</p>

<p>In the Hebrides a popular charm against the wiles of
sorcerers consisted in placing pieces of flint and untempered
steel in the milk of cows alleged to have been
bewitched. The milk was then boiled, and this process
was thought to foil the machinations of the witch or
enchantress.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> The fairies of the Scottish lowlands were
supposed to use arrows tipped with white flint, wherewith
they shot the cattle of persons obnoxious to them,
the wounds thus inflicted being invisible except to certain
personages gifted with supernatural sight.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>According to a Cornish belief, iron is potent to control
the water-fiends, and when thrown overboard enables
mariners to land on a rocky coast with safety even
in a rough sea.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> A similar superstition exists in the
Orkney Islands with reference to a certain rock on the
coast of Westray. It is thought that when any one
with a piece of iron about him steps upon this rock,
the sea at once becomes turbulent and does not subside
until the magical substance is thrown into the
water.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>The inhabitants of the rocky island of Timor, in the
Indian Archipelago, carry about them scraps of iron
to preserve themselves from all kinds of mishaps, even
as the London cockney cherishes with care his lucky
penny, crooked sixpence, or perforated shilling; while
in Hindostan iron nails are frequently driven in over a
door, or into the legs of a bedstead, as protectives. It
was a mediæval wedding custom in France to place on
the bride’s finger a ring made from a horse-shoe nail,<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> a
superstitious bid, as it were, for happy auspices.</p>

<p>In Sicily, iron amulets are popularly used against the
evil eye; indeed iron in any form, especially the horse-shoe,
is thought to be effective, and in fact talismanic
properties are ascribed to all metals. When, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
a Sicilian feels that he is being “overlooked,” he instantly
touches the first available metallic object, such
as his watch-chain, keys, or coins.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> In ancient Babylon
and Assyria it was believed that invisible demons might
enter the body during the acts of eating and drinking
and thus originate disease, and the doctrine of demoniacal
possession as the cause of illness is still widely
prevalent in uncivilized communities at the present day.
Wherever, therefore, such notions exist, talismans are
naturally employed to render inert the machinations of
these little demons; and of all these safeguards, iron
and steel are perhaps the most potent. Quite commonly
in Germany, among the lower classes, such articles as
knives, hatchets, and cutting instruments generally, as
well as fire-irons, harrows, keys, and needles, are considered
protectives against disease if placed near or about
the sick person.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>In Morocco it is customary to place a dagger under
the patient’s pillow,<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> and in Greece a black-handled
knife is similarly used to keep away the nightmare.</p>

<p>In Germany iron implements laid crosswise are considered
to be powerful anti-witch safeguards for infants;
and in Switzerland two knives, or a knife and fork, are
placed in the cradle under the pillow. In Bohemia a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
knife on which a cross is marked, and in Bavaria a pair
of opened scissors, are similarly used. In Westphalia an
axe and a broom are laid crosswise on the threshold,
the child’s nurse being expected to step over these articles
on entering the room.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>The therapeutic value of iron and its use as a medicament
do not properly belong to our subject; and,
indeed, neither the iron horse-shoe nor its counterfeit
symbol have usually been much employed in folk-medicine.
Professor Sepp, in his work on the religion of the
early Germans, mentions, however, a popular cure for
whooping-cough, which consisted in having the patient
eat off of a wooden platter branded with the figure of
a horse-shoe.</p>

<p>In France, also, a favorite panacea for children’s diseases
consists in laying on the child an accidentally
found horse-shoe, with the nails remaining in it; and
in Mecklenburg gastric affections are thought to be
successfully treated by drinking beer which has been
poured upon a red-hot horse-shoe.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>Pliny ascribed healing power to a cast-off horse-shoe
found on the road. The finder was recommended carefully
to preserve such a horse-shoe; and should he at
any future time be afflicted with the hiccoughs, the
mere recollection of the exact spot where the shoe had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
been placed would serve as a remedy for that sometimes
obstinate affection.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>In Bavaria a popular alleged cure for hernia in children
is as follows: From a horse-shoe wherein all the
nails remain, and which has been cast by a horse, a nail
is taken; and when next a new moon comes on a Friday,
one must go into a field or orchard before sunrise
and drive the nail by three blows into an oak-tree or
pear-tree, according to the sex of the child, and thrice
invoke the name of Christ; after which one must kneel
on the ground in front of the tree and repeat a <cite>Paternoster</cite>.
This is an example of a kind of therapeutic
measure not uncommon among peasants in different
parts of Germany, a blending of the use of a superstitious
charm with religious exercises.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>An ingenious theory ascribes the origin of the belief
in the magical properties of iron to the early employment
of the actual cautery, and to the use of the lancet
in surgery.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> In either case the healing effects of the
metal, whether hot or in the form of a knife, have been
attributed by superstitious minds to magical properties
in the instruments, whereby the demons who caused the
disease were put to flight. In northern India the
natives believe that evil spirits are so simple-minded as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
to run against the sharp edge of a knife and thus do
themselves injury; and they also make use of iron rings
as demon-scarers, such talismans having the double efficacy
of the iron and of the sacred circle.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>In Bombay, when a child is born, the natives place an
iron bar along the threshold of the room of confinement
as a guard against the entrance of demons.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> This practice
is derived from the Hindoo superstition that evil
spirits keep aloof from iron; and even to-day pieces of
horse-shoes are to be seen nailed to the bottom sills
of the doors of native houses.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> In east Bothnia, when
the cows leave their winter quarters for the first time,
an iron bar is laid before the threshold of the door
through which the animals must pass, and the farmers
believe that, if this precaution were omitted, the cows
would prove troublesome throughout the summer.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> So,
too, in the region of Saalfield, in central Germany, it is
customary to place axes, saws, and other iron and steel
implements outside the stable door to keep the cattle
from bewitchment.</p>

<p>The Scandinavian peasants, when they venture upon
the water, are wont to protect themselves against the
power of the <i>Neck</i>, or river-spirit, by placing a knife
in the bottom of the boat, or by fixing an iron nail in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
a reed. The following is the translation of a charm
used in Norway for this purpose:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Neck, Neck, nail in water, the Virgin Mary casteth steel
in water. Do you sink, I flit.</p>

</div>

<p>In Finland there is an evil fairy known as the Alp
Nightmare. Its name in the vernacular is <i>Painajainen</i>,
which means in English “Presser.” This unpleasant
being makes people scream, and causes young children
to squint; and the popular safeguard is steel, or a
broom placed beneath the pillow.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>Friedrich remarks that the Moslems look upon iron
as a divine gift, and that the Finlanders have their
tutelary gods of this metal.</p>

<p>Among the Jews there prevails a popular belief that
one should never make use of a knife or other steel
instrument for the purpose of more readily following
with the eye the pages of the Bible, the Talmud, or
other sacred book. Iron should never be permitted to
touch any book treating of religion, for the two are
incompatible by nature, the one destroying human life
and the other prolonging it.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The Highlanders of Scotland
have a time-honored custom of taking an oath
upon cold iron or steel. The dirk, which was formerly
an indispensable adjunct to the Highland costume, is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
favorite and handy object for the purpose. The faith
in the magical power of steel and iron against evil-disposed
fairies and ghosts was universal, and this form of
oath was more solemn and binding than any other.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Among the Bavarian peasants nails and needles have
a reputation the reverse of that of the horse-shoe. A
horse-shoe nail stuck into the front door of a house will
give the owner a serious illness. A needle, when given
to a friend, is sure to prick to death existing friendship,
even as such friendship is severed by the gift of a knife
or pair of scissors. Such an untoward result may be
averted, however, if the recipient smile pleasantly when
the gift is made. A curious superstition about iron
locks prevails in Styria and Tyrol. If you procure from
a locksmith a brand-new lock and carry it to church at
the time of a wedding ceremony, and if, while the benediction
is being said, you fasten the lock by a turn of
the key, then the young couple’s love and happiness
is destroyed. Mutual aversion will supplant affection
until you open the lock again.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<h3>VII. BLACKSMITHS CREDITED WITH SUPERNATURAL
ATTRIBUTES</h3>

<p>Vulcan, the Roman god of fire, the Hephæstus of
Grecian mythology, was also the patron of blacksmiths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and workers in metals. He was the great artisan of the
universe, and at his workshop in Olympus he fashioned
armor for the warriors of the heroic age. On earth
volcanoes were his forges, and his favorite residence
was the island of Lemnos in the Ægean Sea. Beneath
Ætna, with the aid of those famed artisans, the Cyclops,
he forged the thunderbolts of Jove; and there
also, according to tradition, were made the trident of
Neptune, Pluto’s helmet, and the shield of Hercules.
Hephæstus was thus a controller and master of fire.</p>

<p>The Cyclops were believed by the ancients to have
invented the art of forging; and the discovery of the
peculiar qualities of iron was attributed to certain mythical
beings called the Dactyls, who dwelt in Phrygia,
and who were thought to have acquired this knowledge
from observation of the fusion of metals at the fabulous
burning of Mount Ida. The Dactyls had the reputation
of being wizards, whose very names possessed a
mysterious protective power when pronounced by persons
exposed to sudden dangers.</p>

<p>Certain semi-fabulous tribes of central Asia, workers
in metals, kept secret the mysteries of their craft, and
were wont to indulge in wild orgies and festivities, which
served to inspire with awe the uninitiated. At such
times they danced until frenzied with excitement, to the
accompaniment of cymbals and tambourines and the
clashing of weapons. The people of neighboring tribes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
feared to approach them, believing that they were possessed
of a magical power which enabled them to transform
one metal into another and to forge thunderbolts.
They were reputed to be masters of fire and of the elements,
and their forges, like Vulcan’s, were volcanoes.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>These barbarous peoples were sometimes confounded
with the Dactyls, Corybantes, Cabiri, and Curetes, traditional
metallurgists endowed with supernatural skill,
and therefore popularly reckoned as magicians, or even
as divinities. For a long period they were supposed to
be vested with the exclusive knowledge of metal-working,
a knowledge shrouded in mystery.</p>

<p>In the “Kalevalla,” or ancient epic poem of Finland,
the blacksmith Ilmarinen is represented as the pioneer
and most skilled of artisans, who fashioned both the
implements of warfare and domestic utensils. This
hero</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Teutonic mythology, blacksmiths were magical
craftsmen; and even in the Middle Ages they were
looked upon as superior to other artisans, owing to their
faculty of seemingly toying with fire, rendering the
dangerous element subservient to their will, and by its
aid manipulating iron with ease and dexterity. In
Germany their workshops were known as “Wieland’s
houses,” in remembrance of the most cunning of smiths
in the mythical lore of the North.</p>

<p>As in early ages the origin of metal-working was imputed
to divine beings, it was natural that in popular
tradition blacksmiths acquired their wondrous technical
skill through the assistance of such beings, and
hence were exalted above the plane of ordinary mortals
because they had received supernatural instruction.…</p>

<p>The following mediæval legend serves to show that
memories of the old pagan traditions lingered in the
minds of the Scandinavians until long after the establishment
among them of Christianity. One evening in
the year 1208, a horseman rode up to the house of a
blacksmith named Thord Vettir, who lived in southern
Norway at Nesjar, near the town of Laurvig on the
Skager-Rack, and asked for lodging overnight and
shoeing for his horse. The smith assented, and early
the next morning began the work, chatting meanwhile
with his guest. “Where were you last night?” he
inquired of the latter. “In Medaldal,” was the reply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
“And where were you the night before?” asked the
smith. “In Jardal,” answered the stranger. “You
must be a tremendous liar,” said the smith, with great
frankness. Then he applied himself to his task in earnest,
and forged the biggest horse-shoes which he had
ever seen, but which were found to fit the horse’s feet
perfectly. In the course of further conversation the
traveler remarked that he had long dwelt in the north
of Norway and was on his way to Sweden. When he
was ready to continue journeying and had mounted his
steed, the smith inquired his name. “Have you ever
heard of Odin?” was the rejoinder. “I have heard
his name,” said the smith. “Then you may see him
now,” remarked the horseman, “and, if you do not believe
what I have told you, look how I leap my horse
over the fence.” Thereupon he spurred the animal and
rode straight at the court-yard fence, which was seven
ells high. The gallant steed cleared the fence with
ease, and neither he nor his rider were seen again by
the worthy blacksmith.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>The dignity and importance of the blacksmith’s art
in early mediæval times in England is illustrated by the
following tale from Paul Sébillot’s “Légendes et Curiosités
des Métiers,” art. “Forgerons:”—</p>

<p>King Alfred the Great, who reigned in the latter
part of the ninth century, on one occasion assembled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
together seven of his principal mechanics and craftsmen,
and announced that he would appoint as their chief that
one who could longest dispense with the assistance of
the others; and he also invited them all to a banquet,
on condition that each should bring with him a specimen
of his handiwork and the tools wherewith it was
made. At the appointed time they all appeared: the
blacksmith brought his hammer and a horse-shoe; the
tailor his scissors and a newly made garment; the baker
his long-handled wooden bread-shovel and a loaf of
bread; the shoemaker his awl and a pair of new shoes;
the carpenter his saw and a squared plank; the butcher
his chopping-knife and a large piece of meat; and the
mason his trowel and a corner-stone. After careful
deliberation the company decided that the tailor’s work
was the best, and he was accordingly chosen to be chief
of the artisans.</p>

<p>The blacksmith was vexed at the choice, and vowed
he would work no more, so long as the tailor was chief;
he therefore closed his shop and took his departure.</p>

<p>But his absence was speedily felt; the king’s horse
lost a shoe, the six comrades one after another broke
their tools, and, although the tailor continued to ply his
trade longer than the others, he too was soon obliged
to cease from work. Thereupon the king and his
tradesmen decided to try their hands at blacksmithing,
but met with ill success; for the king’s horse trod on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
his royal master, the tailor burnt his fingers, and the
others met with various mishaps. At length they began
to quarrel among themselves, even coming to blows,
and in the mêlée the anvil was overturned with a crash.
Just at this point Saint Clement appeared on the scene
arm in arm with the blacksmith. The king saluted the
newcomers respectfully, and addressed them as follows:
“I have made a bad mistake, my friends, in allowing
myself to be beguiled by the tailor’s fine cloth and his
skillful handiwork; in common fairness the blacksmith,
without whose aid the other workmen can accomplish
nothing, should be proclaimed chief artisan.” All the
tradesmen except the tailor then begged the worthy
smith to make new tools for them, which he forthwith
proceeded to do, even including a brand-new pair of
scissors for the tailor.</p>

<p>Then the king reorganized the society of artisans and
proclaimed as chief the blacksmith, whom all greeted
with wishes for good health and happiness.</p>

<p>After this the king called on each one for a song,
and the new chief in his turn sang one entitled “The
Merry Blacksmith,” which is even nowadays sometimes
heard at the festivities of tradesmen’s guilds in England.</p>

<p>Saint Clement, who figures in the above tale, was the
patron saint of farriers. He was a Roman bishop, who
died <span class="smcapuc">A. D.</span> 100. In ecclesiastical tradition he was reckoned
among the martyrs, having been bound to an anchor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and thrown into the sea on November 23 of that
year. His name-day was still observed in recent times
by English blacksmiths, who regarded him as the originator
of the art of practical farriery, and held an
annual festival in his honor.</p>

<p>The blacksmiths’ apprentices of the Woolwich dockyard
were wont to form a procession on the evening of
Saint Clement’s Day, one of their number personating
“Old Clem,” with masked face, oakum wig, and long
white beard.</p>

<p>During the festivities this worthy delivered a speech,
in part as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I am the real Saint Clement, the first founder of brass,
iron, and steel from the ore. I have been to Mount Ætna,
where the god Vulcan first built his forge, and forged the
armor and thunderbolts for the god Jupiter.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Saint Eloy, or Saint Eligius, is sometimes represented
as the guardian of farriers and blacksmiths. He flourished
in the seventh century, and in his youth served
as apprentice to a goldsmith at Limoges, where he became
very proficient in the art of working the precious
metals. His festival occurs on December 1.</p>

<p>According to a well-known legend, Saint Eloy was
once shoeing a demoniac horse, which refused to stand
still; he therefore cut off the animal’s leg and put on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the shoe. Then, making the sign of the cross, he replaced
the leg, the horse experiencing no ill effects from
the operation.</p>

<p>This saint is mentioned in Barnaby Googe’s “Popish
Kingdome,” as follows:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And Loye the smith doth looke to horse, and smithes of all degree;</div>
<div class="verse">If they with iron meddle here, or if they goldsmithes bee.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In certain countries blacksmiths and farriers have
always been credited with supernatural faculties, and it
seems, therefore, reasonable thus to explain the origin
of some portion of the alleged mystic virtues of their
handiwork, the iron horse-shoe, although indeed this
view does not appear to have been advanced hitherto.</p>

<p>Among ourselves, and in some of the principal European
countries, blacksmiths are highly respectable members
of society, although they do not usually deal in occult
science. But in portions of the Russian empire, as
in the province of Mingrelia, the Caucasus, and neighboring
regions, blacksmiths do enjoy a certain reputation
as magicians. Solemn oaths are taken upon the anvil
instead of upon the Bible. In Abyssinia and in the
Congo country all iron-workers have the reputation of
sorcerers, and among the Tibbous of central Africa they
are treated with great deference. When an inhabitant
of the Orkney Islands wishes to obtain an amulet, he
applies either to a farrier, or to his son or grandson;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and the Roumanian gypsies are mostly blacksmiths,
their wives obtaining a livelihood by mendicancy, the
practice of divination, and the interpretation of dreams;
while both men and women are thought to have the
faculty of summoning to their aid powerful spirits of
the air.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>In Morocco, at the present day, there still exists a
community of dwarfish artisans, workers in metals,
magicians, and adepts in the healing art, who make little
books which are used as portable amulets; and the
Haratin, who inhabit the Drah valley, deem it sinful
even to mention by name these dwarfs, whom they consider
entitled to extraordinary respect.</p>

<p>Each member of this mysterious tribe of pigmy
smiths is said to wear a <i>haik</i>, or outer garment, having
upon the back a representation of an eye, a symbol suggestive
of the Cyclops of old.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>There was, indeed, as we have seen, a common opinion
throughout a great part of Europe that the earliest
smiths were supernatural beings; for it was reasoned
that the marvelous process of melting and fashioning
iron could not have been conceived by man, but must
have originated through magical agencies.</p>

<p>In Germany blacksmith’s forges were often situated
on highways remote from settlements, and were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
resort of travelers and teamsters, who stopped either
to have a horse shod, or to obtain veterinary advice.
Quite naturally these smithies, like the modern crossroads
variety stores, became little centres of sociability
and gossip, and even of conviviality. Moreover, questionable
characters sometimes frequented these places,
and hence their reputation was not always savory.
But the blacksmith himself, by virtue of his calling,
was looked upon with respect, even after his craft had
ceased to inspire the vulgar with mysterious awe.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>In south Germany and the Tyrol, when a blacksmith
rests from his work on a Saturday evening, he strikes
with his hammer three blows upon the anvil, thereby
chaining up the Devil for the ensuing week. And so
likewise, while hammering a horse-shoe into shape, he
strikes the anvil instead of the shoe every fourth or
fifth blow, and thus makes doubly secure the chain
wherewith Satan is bound.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>Blacksmiths are usually clever enough to recognize
the Devil, even when disguised as a gentleman.</p>

<p>Once upon a time the Evil One appeared at the door
of a smith in the village of Gossensass, on the Brenner
road, Tyrol, and wished to have his two horses shod.
When the work was done, he inquired how much he
should pay; but the shrewd smith refused to take any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
money, and only stipulated that his customer should
never enter the shop again, which the Devil promised
and went away.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>The magicians of Hindostan, when treating cases of
alleged demoniacal possession, after the performance of
other mystic rites, are wont to sprinkle the patient with
water from a blacksmith’s shop, the water having been
endowed with additional virtue by the repeated immersion
of iron.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>In northeast Scotland a cure for rickets consists in
having the child bathed by a blacksmith in the water-trough
of the smithy. Then he is laid on the anvil
and iron implements are passed over him, the use of
each being asked, and the ceremony is followed by a
second bath. To insure the efficacy of this process,
three blacksmiths of the same name must take part
in it.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>In Henderson’s “Folk-Lore of the Northern Countries
of England,” p. 187, mention is made of a remarkable
method of treatment intended for the development of
sickly, puny children who are thought to be under the
influence of an evil spell which retards their growth,—a
notable instance of survival of the old belief in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
blacksmith’s magical powers. Very early in the morning
the little patient is brought to the shop of a smith
of the seventh generation, if such can be found, and
laid quite naked on the anvil. The blacksmith raises
his hammer thrice as if to strike a glowing horse-shoe,
each time letting it gently fall on the child’s body,—a
simple ceremony, but vastly promotive of the child’s
physical welfare, in the minds of its rustic parents.</p>

<p>The farriers of the Arabs inhabiting the oases of the
great Sahara desert are exempt from taxes and enjoy
numerous privileges. Of these the most important and
striking, as showing the honor accorded to the men of
this craft, is the following:—</p>

<p>When, on the battlefield, a mounted farrier is hard
pressed by enemies, he runs the risk of being killed so
long as he remains upon his horse with weapons in his
hand. But if he alights, kneels down, and with the
corners of his hooded cloak or <i>burnous</i> imitates the
movements of a pair of bellows, thus revealing his profession,
his life is spared.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>The Baralongs of South Africa regard the art of
smelting and forging as sacred, and, when the metal
begins to flow, none are permitted to approach the furnaces
except those who are initiated in the mysteries of
the craft.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>In Finland, also, blacksmiths are held in profound
respect, and the greatest luxuries are none too good for
them. They are presented with brandy to keep them
in good humor; and a Finnish proverb says, “Fine
bread always for the smith, and dainty morsels for the
hammerer.”<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>Among certain tribes of the west coast of equatorial
Africa the blacksmith officiates also as priest or medicine-man,
and is a chief personage in the community,
which often embraces several adjacent villages. Indeed,
there appears to be a quite general belief in different
portions of Africa that metal-workers as a class are
superior beings,—of higher origin than their fellow-tribesmen.
When a savage people, without a knowledge
of farriery, acquired by conquest a new territory,
and found therein blacksmiths plying their vocation,
they naturally regarded these artisans with wonder, not
unmixed with fear.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, the early association, in mythology and
tradition, of metal-working and sorcery, appears to explain
in a measure, as already suggested, the reason for
the magical properties popularly ascribed to horse-shoes
and to iron articles generally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<h3>VIII. FIRE AS A SPIRIT-SCARING ELEMENT</h3>

<p>The horse-shoe is a product of the artisan’s skill by
the aid of fire.</p>

<p>This element has in all ages been considered the
great purifier, and a powerful foe to evil spirits.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>The Chaldeans venerated fire and esteemed it a
deity, and among primitive nations everywhere it has
ever been held sacred. The Persians had fire-temples,
called <i lang="la">Pyræa</i>, devoted solely to the preservation of the
holy fire.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>In the “Rig-Veda,” the principal sacred book of the
Hindus, the crackling of burning fagots was listened
to as the voice of the gods, and the same superstition
prevails still among the natives of Borneo.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>In a fragment of the writings of Menander Protector,
a Greek historian of the sixth century, it is related that
when an embassy sent by the Emperor Justin reached
Sogdiana, the ancient Bokhara, it was met by a party
of Turks, who proceeded to exorcise their baggage by
beating drums and ringing bells over it. They then
ran around the baggage, bearing aloft flaming leaves,
meantime, by their gestures and movements, seeking to
repel evil spirits; after which some of the party themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
passed through fire as a means of purification.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>Fire is especially potent against nocturnal demons,
and also against the evil spirits which cause disease in
cattle. Hence the utility of the ancient “need-fires,”
produced by the friction of two pieces of wood, which
were thought to be an antidote against the murrain
and epizoötics generally,—a custom until recently in
vogue in the Scottish Highlands, and formerly practiced
in many other regions.</p>

<p>The midsummer fires kindled on Saint John’s Eve,
in accordance with an ancient British custom, were
regarded as purifiers of the air. Moreover, the whole
area of ground illuminated by these fires was reckoned
to be freed from sorcery for a year, and, by leaping
through the flames, both men and cattle were insured
safety against demons for a like period.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>In Ireland it was customary for people to run
through the streets on Saint John’s Eve carrying long
poles, upon which were tied flaming bundles of straw,
in order to purify the air, for at that time all kinds of
mischievous imps, hobgoblins, and devils were abroad,
intent on working injury to human beings.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>Midsummer fires were still lighted in Ireland in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
latter half of the nineteenth century, a survival of
pagan fire-worship. In many countries people gathered
about the bonfires, while children leaped through the
flames, and live coals were carried into the cornfields
as an antidote to blight.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>Sometimes the remaining ashes were scattered over
the neighboring fields, in order to protect the crops
from ravaging vermin or insects; and in Sweden the
smoke of need-fires was reputed to stimulate the growth
of fruit-trees, and to impart luck to fishing-nets hung
up in it.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>When a child is born, the Hindus light fires to
frighten demons; and for the same reason lamps are
swung to and fro at weddings, and fire is carried before
the dead body at a funeral.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>Devout Brahmins keep a fire constantly burning in
their houses and worship it daily, expecting thereby to
secure for themselves good fortune. The origin of the
respect accorded to fire among these people has been
attributed to its potency in alleviating or curing certain
diseases,<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> as, for example, when applied in the actual
cautery, or by means of the moxa; for, wherever a
belief exists in demoniacal possession as the cause of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
bodily disorders, the cure of the latter is evidence that
the malignant spirits have been put to flight.</p>

<p>The fire-worshiping Parsees also keep a fire continuously
in the lying-in room; and when a child is ailing
from any cause, they fasten to its left arm a magical
charm of written words prepared by a priest, exorcising
the evil spirits in the name of their chief deity, Ormuzd,
and “binding them by the power and beauty
of fire.”<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>On the birth of a child among the Khoikhoi of south
Africa a household fire is kindled, which is maintained
until the healing of the child’s navel; and when a
member of the tribe goes a-hunting, his wife is careful
to keep a fire burning indoors; for, if it were allowed
to go out, the husband would have no luck.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>The conception of a mediæval smith as a master and
controller of fire was embodied in a group of figures
modeled by the Austrian sculptor, Karl Bitter, and
placed at the southern entrance of the Administration
Building at the World’s Fair, Chicago, in 1893. This
group, which was called “Fire Controlled,” consisted
of a female figure, whose uplifted right hand carried a
torch, while at her feet stood a brawny smith resting
a sledge hammer upon the prostrate form of a fire
demon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Above this group stood a single figure, by the same
artist, representing a blacksmith standing at his anvil,
with hammer resting against it, and in his belt hung
a pair of pincers. In his left hand was a horse-shoe,
which he was examining.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<h3>IX. THE SERPENTINE SHAPE OF THE HORSE-SHOE</h3>

<p>The theory has been advanced that in ancient idolatrous
times the horse-shoe in its primitive form was a
symbol in serpent-worship, and that its superstitious use
as a charm may have thus originated. This seems
plausible enough, inasmuch as there is a resemblance
between the horse-shoe and the arched body of the
snake, when the latter is so convoluted that its head
and tail correspond to the horse-shoe prongs.</p>

<p>Both snakes and horse-shoes were anciently engraved
on stones and medals, presumably as amuletic symbols;<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
and in front of a church in Crendi, a town in the southern
part of the island of Malta, there is to be seen a
statue having at its feet a protective symbol in the
shape of a half moon encircled by a snake.</p>

<p>The serpent played an important rôle in Asiatic and
ancient Egyptian symbolism. This has been thought
to be due partly to a belief that the sun’s path through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the heavens formed a serpentine curve, and partly because
lightning, or the fertilizing fire, sometimes flashes
upon the earth in a snake-like zigzag.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> The serpent
was endowed with the attributes of divinity on account
of its graceful and easy movements, the brightness of
its eyes, the function of discarding its skin (a process
which was regarded as emblematic of a renewal of its
youth), and its instantaneous spring upon its prey.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
The worship of serpents is of great antiquity, the
earliest authentic accounts of the custom being found
in Chaldean and Chinese astronomical works. It was
nearly universal among the most ancient nations of the
world, and this universality has been ascribed to the
traditionary remembrance of the serpent in Eden,<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
and has given rise to the opinion of some writers that
snake-worship may have been the primitive religion of
the human race.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>On the walls of houses in Pompeii are to be seen the
figures of snakes, which are believed to have been intended
as preservative symbols;<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> and we learn from Mr.
C. G. Leland’s “Etruscan Roman Remains” that the
peasants of the mountainous regions in northern Italy,
known as the Romagna Toscana, have a custom of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
painting on the walls of their houses the figures of serpents
with the heads and tails pointing upward. These
are intended both as amulets to keep away witches, and
as luck-bringers, and are therefore exact counterparts
of the horse-shoe and the crescent as magical emblems.
The more interlaced the snake’s coils, the more effective
the amulet; the idea being that a witch is obliged to
trace out and follow with her eye the interweaving
convolutions, and that in attempting to do this she becomes
bewildered, and is temporarily rendered incapable
of doing harm.</p>

<p>In ancient Roman works of art the serpent is sometimes
portrayed as a protective symbol. In some bronze
figures of Fortune unearthed at Herculaneum, serpents
are represented either as encircling the arm of the
goddess, or as entwined about her cornucopia, thus
typifying, as it were, the idea of the intimate association
of the snake with good luck.</p>

<p>The Phœnicians rendered homage to serpents, and
history shows that the Lithuanians, Sarmatians, or inhabitants
of ancient Poland, and other nations of central
Europe, treated these reptiles with superstitious
respect. In Russia, also, domestic snakes were formerly
carefully nurtured, for they were thought to bring good
fortune to the members of a household.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>The worship of serpents is still practiced in Persia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Tibet, Ceylon, and other Eastern lands. In western
Africa, also, the serpent is a chief deity, and is appealed
to by the natives in seasons of drought and pestilence.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
A talisman having the form of a snake, and known as
<i lang="it">la sirena</i>, is in use among the lower classes at Naples.</p>

<p>In the folk-lore of the south Slavonian nations the
serpent is regarded as a protective genius, not only of
the people, but of domestic animals and houses as well.
Every human being has a snake as tutelary divinity,
with which his growth and well-being are closely connected,
and the killing of one of these sacred creatures
was formerly deemed a grave offense. To meet with
a snake has long been accounted fortunate in some
countries. The south Slav peasant believes that whoever
encounters one of these creatures, on first going
into the woods in the spring, will be prosperous throughout
the year. But on the other hand he regards it as
an evil omen if he happens to catch a glimpse of his
own tutelary serpent. Fortunately, however, a man
never knows which particular ophidian is his special
guardian.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The relation of the serpent to sculptured or engraved stones
reveals to us the reptile as still the object of veneration, if not
of adoration, among widely remote nations. If we search<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
among the tombs of Egypt, Assyria, and Etruria, we shall
find innumerable signets, cylinders, and scarabei of gems engraved
with serpents; these were proverbially worn as amulets,
or used as insignia of authority; and, in the temples and
tombs of these and other countries, serpents are engraved or
sculptured or painted, either as hieroglyphics or as forming
symbolical ornaments of deities or genii. In India they are
sculptured twining around all the gods of the cave temples
which mark the graves of kings and heroes, and the oldest of
the Scandinavian runes are written within the folds of serpents
engraved on stones.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In ancient Mexican temples the serpent symbol is
frequently seen. The approach to the temple of El
Castillo, at Chichen in Yucatan, is guarded by a pair
of huge serpent heads, and a second pair protect the
entrance to the sanctuary. Figures of serpents also
appear in the Mosaic relief designs of the façades, and
within on the sanctuary walls. So, too, in the temples
of Palenque and other southern Mexican towns, serpents
are everywhere plentiful in the decorations and
sculptures.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>Representations of snakes are to be seen on the walls
of houses in many parts of India at the present day,
and villages have their special ophite guardians.</p>

<p>The fifth day of the first or bright half of the lunar
month S’ravana, which nearly corresponds with August,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
is celebrated by the Brahmins in honor of the naga or
cobra. Some interesting details of the ceremonies
on these occasions are given in Balfour’s “Cyclopædia
of India.” We learn from this source that native
women are wont at such times to join in dancing around
snake-holes, and also to prostrate themselves and invoke
blessings; while others bow down before living
cobras at their own homes, or worship figures of serpents.</p>

<p>Visits from snakes are highly appreciated as auspicious
events, and the reptiles are sure of a hospitable
reception, because they are looked upon as tutelary
divinities.</p>

<p>Thus the serpent was held sacred by the nations of
antiquity, being a prominent feature in every mythology
and symbolizing many pagan divinities.</p>

<p>The Vlach women of European Turkey, who inhabit
villages in the mountain ranges of Thessaly and Albania,
treat serpents with great respect and even with
veneration. If one of the harmless white snakes which
abound in the country chances to enter a cottage, it is
provided with food and allowed to depart unharmed,
its appearance indoors being accounted a lucky event.
Such friendly treatment often results in the snake’s becoming
domesticated and receiving the title of “house-serpent.”<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
The Carinthians, too, are wont to treat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
snakes as fondlings, for they consider that these reptiles
bring good luck proportionate in degree to their bodily
diameter; hence they are fed with care and provided
with bowls of milk twice a day.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>Indeed, in many countries the serpent or dragon,
originally a guardian of treasure, is considered a house-protector.
The same conception is embodied in the
grotesque dragon-headed gargoyles so common in mediæval
architecture.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Daniel G. Brinton, in speaking of the emblematic
significance of the serpent among American aborigines,
remarks that this symbol has ever been associated with
religious mysteries.</p>

<p>Many derivatives from the Hebrew and Arabic words
for serpent signify the practice of sorcery, consultation
with familiar spirits, and intercourse with demons.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>It would seem, therefore, not improbable that the
horse-shoe amulet has acquired some portion of the
magical influences ascribed to it through its serpentine
form.</p>

<p>The serpent-symbol has furnished a theme for many
writers, and sumptuous volumes attest its deep interest.</p>

<p>The chief points which relate to our present subject
are briefly: (1) The similarity of form between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
horse-shoe and a serpentine coil, and (2) the association
of ideas resulting therefrom in the popular mind. The
horse-shoe, when allied symbolically to the serpent,
represents a creature which has ever been an object of
superstition, whether as a deity, household guardian, or
embodiment of evil. Hence it suggests magical power,
whether good or evil, but chiefly the idea of beneficent,
protective influence.</p>

<h3>X. THE HORSE-SHOE ARCH IN ANCIENT CALEDONIAN
HIEROGLYPHICS</h3>

<p>The horse-shoe arch was a common emblem on pagan
monuments, and is frequently seen in Caledonian sculptured
hieroglyphics, where it is believed to have had a
special significance as a protective symbol. Lieutenant-Colonel
Forbes Leslie, in “The Early Races of Scotland,”
remarks that the horse-shoe arch was probably
emblematic of the serpent as a protecting and beneficent
power, because this arch closely resembles a
peculiar mark or attribute of the so-called <i>Nagendra</i>,
the hooded serpent-king, a chief deity in the mythical
lore of Ceylon. It would appear quite unnecessary
to refer to the Cingalese mythology in this connection,
inasmuch as the close resemblance between the shape
of the horse-shoe and the arched body of a snake has
already been commented on. As illustrative of the
somewhat unique theory which claims the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
horse-shoe arch, itself a talismanic symbol, as the original
source of all the superstitions associated with the
modern iron horse-shoe, it may be appropriate to quote
a few lines from the authority above mentioned:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Whatever this figure (the horse-shoe arch) may have represented
to our heathen ancestors, it seems very likely that
from it the horse-shoe derived its supposed power of promoting
the fortune of its possessor and protecting him against
threatened calamities, whether designed by men or demons.
Superstition clung to the symbol that was hallowed by antiquity,
and even impressed this emblem of paganism on the
Christianity by which it was superseded.</p>

</div>

<p>The historian Diodorus Siculus said that the Chaldeans
imagined the earth as having the shape of a
round boat turned upside down. The boats still used
on the rivers Tigris and Euphrates resemble in form
a beehive with a considerable bulge in the middle.
Gerald Massey (“The Natural Genesis,” vol. ii. p. 63)
says that this conception of the earth’s figure</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>corresponds to the Egyptian <em>Put-sign</em> with its hollow underneath.
Various forms of this formation of the world are
extant. The horse-shoe is one. <em>Hence its value as a symbol
of superstition.</em> The head-dress of the Egyptian goddess
Hathor has the shape of a horse-shoe. The letter omega (Ω)
is another form of the same sign.</p>

</div>

<p>The Rev. C. Vernon Harcourt, in his “Doctrine of
the Deluge” (vol. i. p. 141), suggests that the moon was
anciently regarded as particularly sacred when in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
first quarter, because at that period it resembled most
closely the ark of Noah, which was crescent-shaped.</p>

<p>Again, the horse-shoe form is believed to be a survival
of an ancient religious symbol often seen in
Assyrian and Egyptian sculptures, signifying the mystical
door of life.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The <i>D</i> of the Italic alphabets placed ⌓ reveals its early
picture origin, while the Greek delta (Δ) represents a tent
door. The Egyptian hieroglyphic for ten was 𓎆. It is plain,
therefore, that the horse-shoe is the mystical door reduced to
its simplest possible form, and as a fetish for bringing good
luck, or as a talisman to avert the evil eye, it would have no
meaning except with the points downward.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

</div>

<p>From a scientific standpoint, therefore, the horse-shoe,
when used as a protective symbol, should be
placed with its convex arch uppermost; but as a luck
token, the reverse position is the proper one, else, according
to a popular notion, the luck may be spilled out.</p>

<p>In northern Germany and Bavaria figures of horse-shoes
are sometimes cut on boundary stones, as for example,
on a stone which separates the hamlets Ellerbek
and Wellingdorf, suburbs of Kiel; and, again, on one
between the estates of Depenau and Bockhorn, in middle
Holstein. In these cases the idea involved is probably
that of the beneficent horse-shoe arch, impartially
guarding the interests of both villages or estates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<h3>XI. THE HORSE-SHOE AS A SYMBOL OF THE HORSE</h3>

<p>But the efficacy of the horse-shoe as a protector of
people and buildings depends not solely upon its arched
shape, nor on its bifurcated form, nor yet upon its
fancied resemblance to a snake. Its relation to the
<em>horse</em> also gives it a talismanic value; for in legendary
lore this animal was often credited with supernatural
qualities. An English myth ascribes to the horse the
character of a luck-bringer, and horse-worship was in
vogue among the early Celts, Teutons, and Slavs.</p>

<p>In Hindostan, also, the horse is regarded as a lucky
animal; and when an equestrian rides into a sugar-cane
field in the sowing season, the event is considered
auspicious. In the same region the froth from a
horse’s mouth is thought to repel demons, which are
believed to have more fear of a horse than of any other
animal. The natives of northern India also believe
that the horse was originally a wingéd creature, and
that the horny protuberances on his legs indicate where
the wings were attached.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>In the Norse mythology almost every deity has his
particular steed, as have most of the heroes of antiquity,
for the heathen nations regarded the horse as sacred
and divine.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Tradition says that when the city of Carthage was
founded by Dido, the Phœnician queen, in the ninth
century <span class="smcapuc">B. C.</span>, a priestess of Juno dug in the ground,
by command of the oracle, and discovered the head
of a bullock. This was considered unsatisfactory, because
bullocks and oxen were servile animals under
the yoke. Thereupon the priestess again turned up
the soil and found a horse’s head, which was reckoned
auspicious, for the horse, although sometimes yoked to
the plough, was also symbolic of war and martial glory.
Therefore a temple of Juno was built on the spot,
and the figure of a horse’s head was adopted as an
emblem by the Carthaginians and stamped upon their
coins.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Ludwig Beck, in his “History of Iron,” states
that in Teutonic legends the horse was sacred to Wodan
or Odin, who always rode, while Thor either drove
about in his chariot or went afoot. Thence it is, says
this writer, that the Devil of the Middle Ages is represented
with the hoofs of a horse.</p>

<p>The reputation of the horse as a prophetic and divinatory
animal, even among Christian peoples, is shown
by various German traditions, of which the following is
an example. When the inhabitants of Delve, a village
in the Duchy of Holstein, were about to build a church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the choice of a site was determined in this manner:
An image of the Virgin was fastened upon the back of
a parti-colored mare, which was then allowed to roam
at will; and it was agreed that the church should be
erected upon the spot where the mare should be found
the next morning. This proved to be a neighboring
bramble-thicket, and the new edifice was accordingly
placed there, and dedicated to “Our beloved Lady on
the Horse.”<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>The ancient belief in the oracular powers of the
horse is well shown by a custom formerly in vogue
among the Pomeranians. On the outbreak of a war
a priest laid three spears at equal distances upon the
ground in front of the temple. Two other spears were
then leaned transversely across them, with their points
resting in the earth. After a prayer the high priest
led up a sacred horse, and if he stepped with his right
foot foremost thrice in succession over the spears without
stumbling, it was accounted a good augury, otherwise
not.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>A dragon-headed horse, emblematic of grandeur,
having on its back the civilizing book of the law, is one
of the four great mythic animals of the Chinese; and
the Tibetans have a like symbol, which they use as a
luck-bringing talisman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>The association of the horse with luck is prominent
in Indian myth as well:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The jewel-horse of the universal monarch, such as Buddha
was to have been had he cared for worldly grandeur, carries
its rider Pegasus-like through the air in whatever direction
wished for, and thus it would become associated with
the idea of material wishes, and especially wealth and
jewels.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Among the lower classes of the Hindus of Bombay,
a notion is prevalent that spirits are frightened by
the sound of a horse’s hoofs; and this superstition has
been thought to explain the custom, in vogue among
the Hindus generally, of having a bridegroom ride a
horse when on his way to the bride’s residence.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>In Bokhara, when a horse stumbles in fording a
stream, and the rider thereby gets an involuntary wetting,
it is considered a most fortunate occurrence instead
of a mishap. In the same country it is also
accounted lucky to meet an equestrian.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>One reason in favor of the theory which ascribes the
horse-shoe’s weird powers to its connection with a luck-bringing
animal is the fact that various portions of
the equine frame serve as amulets in different localities.
Thus not only the horse-shoe but the hoof, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
even a single bone of the foot, may be used for this
object.</p>

<p>In the island of Montserrat the two incisor teeth of
a horse are carried about as charms.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> The popular
belief of many people credits equine hair with special
virtues. “Honor abides in the manes of horses” is a
saying of Mohammed, and in Turkey a horse’s tail
as an emblem is significant of dignity and exalted
position.</p>

<p>In certain villages of Brandenburg every new-born
boy, before his first bath, is placed upon a horse, the
animal being brought into the chamber for the purpose.
This is thought to impart to the child manly qualities
for life. In other districts small children are allowed
to ride a black foal to facilitate the cutting of their
teeth; and the neighings of horses are believed to be
of favorable import if listened to carefully. The popular
belief on this subject is exemplified in the German
saying, “He has horse-luck,” in reference to a piece of
extraordinary good fortune.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>The Irish think that the reason for the horse-shoe’s
magical power is because the horse and the ass were in
the stable where Christ was born, and hence are evermore
blessed animals.</p>

<p>The romantic literature of Ireland affords evidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
of the existence of a species of horse-worship in that
country in former ages, and tradition says that in the
olden time there were horses endowed with human
faculties.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> We learn from Tacitus, moreover, that the
Teutonic peoples</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>used white horses, as the Romans used chickens, for purposes
of augury, and divined future events from different intonations
of neighings. Hence it probably is that the discovery
of a horse-shoe is so universally thought lucky, some of the
feelings that once attached to the animal itself still surviving
around the iron of its hoof. For horses, like dogs and birds,
were universally accredited with a greater insight into futurity
than man himself.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The horse is seen among the insignia of Kent, the
first of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, and is displayed at
the present time on the shields of the houses of Hanover
and Brunswick.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>One of the most solemn forms of oath taken on the
eve of battle required a warrior to swear “by the
shoulder of a horse and the edge of a sword” that he
would not flee from the enemy even if the latter should
be superior in strength.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>At the time of the conquest of Peru, the Indian aborigines
were amazed at the sight of the Spanish horsemen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
believing that man and horse were one creature.
And it is said that Pizarro owed his life to this superstitious
belief; for on one occasion, when pursued by
the natives, he fell from his horse, and the Peruvians
who witnessed the mishap, believing that one animal
had by magic divided itself into two, gave up the pursuit
in dismay.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>M. D. Conway, in his “Demonology and Devil-Lore,”
asserts that the Scandinavian superstition known as the
“demon-mare” is the source of the use of the horse-shoe
against witches. In Germany there is a saying in
reference to the morbid oppression sometimes experienced
during sleep or while dreaming, and which is a
symptom of indigestion, “The nightmare hath ridden
thee.”</p>

<p>This elvish mare rides horses also, and in the morning
their manes are found all tangled and dripping with
sweat.</p>

<p>Grimm says that the traditional idea of the Nightmare
seems to waver between the ridden animal and the
riding, trampling one, precisely as the Devil is sometimes
represented as riding men, and again as taking
them on his back after the manner of a horse.</p>

<p>According to a Bavarian popular belief, the Nightmare
is a woman, who is wont to appear at the house-door
of a morning, invariably requesting the loan of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
some article. In order to get rid of her at night, one
should say: “Come to-morrow and receive the three
white gifts.” The next morning the woman comes, and
is given a handful of flour, a handful of salt, and an
egg.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>In the north of England, naturally perforated stones
are hung up by the side of the manger to prevent the
Night Hag from riding the horses. In a rare book of
the sixteenth century, entitled “The Fower Chiefest
Offices belonging to Horsemanship, by Tho. Blundenill,
of Newton Flotman, in Norffolke,” the following
curious charm is given as a remedy for horses
affected with the nightmare:—</p>

<p>Drink offerings were anciently poured from vessels
made from horses’ hoofs; and witches are popularly
supposed to drink with avidity the water which collects
in equine hoof-tracks. German writers on early traditions
and folk-lore agree in ascribing to the horse-shoe
divers magical properties, whose origin is vaguely
connected with the ancient pagan conception of the
horse as a sacrificial animal.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>According to a popular poetic fancy of the ancient
Teutons, horses, Wodan’s favorite and darling animals,
were endowed with the gifts of speech and prophecy
during the twelve days between Christmas and Epiphany.
At this holy season they were wont to put
their heads together, and impart to each other confidentially
their experiences and trials of the past year;
and this communion of equine spirits was the sole pleasure
vouchsafed to the noble animals, and atoned in a
measure for the hard work which was their lot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Even nowadays many peasants do not venture to
harness their horses at Christmas time, and do not even
speak of the animals by name, but make use of pet
epithets and circumlocutions when they have occasion
to refer to them. On Christmas night, hostlers often
sleep in the manger or under it, and their dreams at
such times are prophetic for the coming year, for in
their sleep they can hear what the horses are saying.</p>

<p>In order to impart health and vigor to the animals
without incurring the expense of extra fodder, the
hostler walks at Epiphany season by night three times
around the village church, carrying in his uplifted
hands a bundle of hay, which he afterwards feeds to
the horses; or on Christmas night he steals some cabbage,
which is then mixed with the fodder; or, before
going to the midnight Christmas Mass, he lays on the
manure-heap a quantity of hay called the “Mass hay,”
and on his return from church this is given to the
horses. Some peasants have a yet more simple method
of promoting the welfare of their horses, which consists
in laying the cleaning-cloth upon a hedge on the evenings
of Christmas, New Year’s Day, or Epiphany, and
afterwards grooming the animals with the dew-laden
cloth.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>In the popular mind horses are credited with extraordinarily
keen faculties for detecting ghosts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
haunted places, which they instinctively scent from
afar. The Thuringian peasant does not beat his horse
when the latter refuses to proceed along some gloomy
forest road; for the whip is useless against spiritual
obstacles, whereas a <cite>Paternoster</cite> devoutly repeated is
usually much more effective.</p>

<p>It is a Bohemian superstition that a horse sees everything
magnified tenfold, and that this is the reason why
the noble animal submits to being led by a little child.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>When a Brandenburg rustic has bought a horse in a
neighboring town and rides him homeward, he dismounts
at the boundary line of his own village, and,
gathering a handful of his native soil, he throws it
backward over the line to prevent the animal’s being
bewitched. In Bohemia the chief signs of bewitchment
in a horse are thought to be shivering, profuse
sweating, and emaciation. A charm against this consists
in drawing one’s shirt inside out over one’s head,
and using it as a wherewithal to groom the animal,—a
method which may be acceptable to superstitious
jockeys and hostlers, but which will hardly commend
itself to a fastidious horse-owner.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<h3>XII. HORSES’ HEADS AS TALISMANS</h3>

<p>In early times it was customary to use horses’ heads
as talismans, by means of which also the ancient heathen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
nations practiced various magical arts. Grimm says in
his “Teutonic Mythology” that the Scandinavians had
a custom of fastening a horse’s head to a pole, with the
mouth propped open with a stick. The gaping jaws
were then turned in the direction whence an enemy
was likely to come, in order to cast over him an evil
spell. This contrivance was known as a spite-stake,
or nithing-post. In Mallet’s “Northern Antiquities”
(p. 156, 1890), it is related that Eigil, a famous Icelandic
bard, on being banished from Norway in the ninth century,
fixed a stake in the ground and fastened thereon
a horse’s head, saying meanwhile: “I here set up a
nithing-stake, and turn this my banishment against King
Eirek and Queen Gunhilda.” Then, pointing the horse’s
head toward the interior of Norway, he uttered a solemn
imprecation against the protecting deities of the
land, invoking evil upon them, and expressing a wish
that they might be compelled to wander about and
never find rest until they had driven forth the hated
king and queen. In these cases the horse’s head was
magically employed as an instrument for working evil
upon an enemy, but later the same symbol was widely
used among northern peoples as a talisman <em>against</em>
evil.</p>

<p>Not alone in remote antiquity, but throughout the
Middle Ages, the old pagan device of the spite-stake
continued to be employed by the Teutonic peoples; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
even after the Reformation, as late as the year 1584, a
mare’s skull placed upon a pole was a favorite means
for driving away rats and other vermin in Germany.
The principle involved appears to have been always the
same, namely, the power of averting evil supposed to
be a magical attribute of horses’ heads; and this power
was not only effective against human enemies, but likewise
against the spirits of evil.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>When the Roman general Cæcina Severus reached
the scene of Varus’s defeat by the German tribes under
their chieftain Arminius, in the year 9 <span class="smcapuc">A. D.</span>, near the
river Weser, he saw numbers of horses’ heads fastened
to the trunks of trees. These were the heads of
Roman horses which the Germans had sacrificed to
their gods.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>In the fifteenth century a savage tribe known as the
Wends had a practice of placing a horse’s head in the
crib or manger to counteract the influence of evil spirits,
and to prevent their horses from being ridden by the
Night Hag. And in many countries analogous notions,
veritable relics of paganism, exist in full force to-day.
Thus in Mecklenburg and Holstein it is a common
usage to place the carved wooden representations of the
heads of horses on the gables of houses as safeguards,
and when fixed upon poles in the vicinity of stables they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
are thought to ward off epizoötics. In Mecklenburg,
also, horses’ heads, when placed beneath the pillows of
the sick, are believed to act as febrifuges, and in Holland
they are hung up over pigsties. The fore-parts
of horses are to be seen on the gables of old houses in
the Rhætian Alps, “carved out of the ends of the intersecting
principals.”<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>The use of horses’ heads as talismans is thought to
have some connection with the ancient pagan sacrificial
offerings of horses. Adherence to the latter custom
was formerly regarded as a pledge of loyalty to heathenism,
and conversely its renunciation was a sign of
adopting the new religion. In the tenth century the
Norwegian king Hakon Athelstan, known as “Hakon
the Good,” endeavored persistently to extirpate heathen
idolatry in his kingdom, but without much success,
owing to the vigorous opposition of his people. At one
of their great Yule-tide festivals the king was urged to
eat some horse’s flesh as a proof of devotion to the old
faith, and on his refusal to do this they wished to kill
him.</p>

<p>On another occasion King Hakon so far yielded to
the importunities of his people as to inhale the steam
from a kettle of horse-broth. He also drank some Yule-beer,
holding the cup in his left hand, while with his
right he made the sign of the cross, which the pagan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
mind conceived to be the symbol of Thor’s hammer.
Finally he was even induced to eat a couple of mouthfuls
of horse-flesh, an act which his people accepted as
a satisfactory guarantee of his orthodoxy.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>Among the newly converted Northern nations the use
of horse-flesh as food fell into disrepute, and the practice
was looked upon as a secret sacrifice to the old
idols, while those indulging in it were punished as obdurate
pagans.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>The employment of horses’ heads as talismans, a
custom doubtless originating in heathendom, has been
thought not only to suggest the sacrificial offering of a
horse, but also to symbolize the religious dedication of a
building placed under the protective influence of such
a symbol. For among the ancient Teutons the horse
was held to be the most holy of animals, and auguries
were derived from the neighings of white horses in their
sacred groves. There exists, moreover, among German
peasants a widespread belief that the placing of carved
wooden representations of horses’ heads upon house-gables
is an act of homage to the Deity, whose blessing
and benediction are thereby invoked upon the dwellings
thus adorned, and upon the inmates as well. When,
however, the heads are directed <em>outwards</em>, in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
ward off evil, the principle involved is evidently akin
to that of the pagan spite-stake, of which mention has
been made.</p>

<p>Professor Christian Petersen, of Hamburg, who investigated
this subject some years ago, expressed the belief
that among the pagans every dwelling was protected by
three talismanic emblems, namely: (1) on the gable a
<em>horse’s head</em>, or the representation of some other animal
or bird; (2) by the side of the entrance door a <em>broom</em>,
as a preservative against lightning; and (3) on the
threshold a <em>horse-shoe</em>.</p>

<p>The German botanist, Karl Friedrich von Ledebour,
who visited the Altai Mountains early in the present
century, wrote that among the Kalmuks, a nomadic
people inhabiting that region, he observed numerous
horses’ heads and hides, relics of sacrifices, placed upon
scaffolds; and the direction of the horses’ heads, pointing
east or west, indicated whether the sacrificial offering
was made to a good or evil deity.<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>Formerly in some parts of Germany, especially in the
north, it was customary to place a horse’s head above
the stable door; sometimes also horses were killed and
their bodies buried beneath the corner-stone of a building,
in order to bring good luck. In the same region
the association of horses and horse-shoes with lucky
influences is everywhere apparent: a horse-shoe when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
found is either carried about as an amulet, or placed on
the chamber wall or threshold; and a young girl who
finds a certain number of horse-shoes in a year, or who
sees a hundred white horses within the same period, will
be married before the year is out.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>In Moldavia the head of a horse or of an ass is much
esteemed on account of its reputed magical properties,
and is believed to be a powerful agent not only for the
production of witchcraft, but conversely as a powerful
antagonist of evil.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> Inclosures where animals are kept
are very commonly protected by one of these talismans
placed upon a forked stake; and the same device is
popular as a safeguard against wolves and robbers.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> In
Roumania the skull of a horse is placed over a court-yard
gate as a preservative against ghosts, and in
Tuscany it is also used as a charm.<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>The Christmas festivities at Ramsgate, in Kent, formerly
included a peculiar feature called “going a-hodening.”
A horse’s head fixed on a pole was carried
through the town by a party of young people, grotesquely
attired and ringing hand-bells. By pulling a
string attached to the lower jaw, the horse’s mouth
was made to open and shut with a snapping sound.
In this case the horse’s head was typical of the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Demon, threatening and overcoming the powers of
darkness.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>It appears that a modern counterpart of the ancient
heathen practice of hanging equine heads upon trees,
as tributes to Wodan, still exists in Sussex, where the
bodies of horses are suspended by the legs from horizontal
tree-branches, as a means of bringing luck to the
cattle. And the evident analogy between the two customs
of widely separated epochs, the sacrificial offering
of horses upon trees in order to avert evil or to invoke
protection, has not escaped the attention of modern
writers.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>The Ostiaks of southern Siberia were wont to suspend
horses’ heads from the branches of trees, and to
protect bees from witchcraft they also placed them near
the hives.<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>In Bulgaria and among the Osseten, an Asiatic tribe,
the same talismans are affixed to the palings inclosing
farmyards. The ancient Teuton placed a horse’s head
on the weather-vane of his barn, while he hung up a
horse-shoe in some consecrated place, as a deprecatory
offering to the god of thunder and storms;<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> and the
Tartars of the Chinese province of Koukou-Nor seek to
protect their bees from the “evil eye” by hanging up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
near the hives either a skull, a foot, or in fact any bone
of a horse.</p>

<p>In Mecklenburg one remedy for the delirium of fever
consists in placing a horse’s skull under the bed; and in
some parts of Prussia certain spinal affections of children
are treated by bathing the patient in rain-water in
which a horse’s head has been dipped thrice daily for
three successive Thursdays.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> In a curious old work by
M. Fugger (1854), the writer says that a mare’s skull,
fixed on a pole and placed in a garden, has a wonderful
effect in promoting the growth of plants and vegetables,
and, moreover, insures freedom from rats and caterpillars.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>The Magyar shepherds place horses’ and asses’ skulls
as talismans about their sheepfolds to keep wolves
away from their flocks, and also to prevent herbaceous
animals other than their sheep from eating the grass of
their pasture lands. Also when, as occasionally happens,
some hill or upland region gains an unsavory reputation
among the peasants as an alleged meeting-place
of witches, horses’ skulls are placed there in order to
prevent such unseemly orgies, for, according to the popular
report, where witches meet grass will not grow.
Whoever has the courage to visit such a place on the
midnight of Good Friday with a so-called <i>Luciastuhl</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
a peculiar chair or stool made during Christmas week,
may see the witches at their revels, and may easily disperse
them by throwing a horse’s skull into their
midst.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>The gypsies inhabiting lands bordering on the eastern
Danube are wont to fasten the skulls of horses and
cattle upon the fence-palings which surround their farmyards,
to prevent witches and evil spirits from entering
the inclosures. So, too, the Transylvanian gypsies
bury horses’ skulls beneath the floor of the earth caverns
which they occupy in winter; and the tribes of
southern Hungary place similar talismans upon the
graves of their kindred, that no witch may tread upon
the sanctified ground.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>The wizards and conjurers of the Shamans pretend
to be experts in sorcery, and to possess a secret knowledge
which enables them to control the actions of evil
spirits. They wear a long elk-skin robe adorned with
many fetich objects, such as bells and pieces of iron;
and to assist them in their magic rites they carry staves,
whose tops are carved into the shape of horses’ heads,
and by means of these staves they are enabled to leap
high into the air.<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<h3>XIII. THE HORSE-SHOE AS A FAVORITE ANTI-WITCH
CHARM</h3>

<p>The <em>universality</em> of the use of the horse-shoe as a
safeguard against evil spirits is indeed noteworthy.</p>

<p>It is the anti-witch charm <i lang="fr">par excellence</i>, as well as
the approved symbol of good luck, and, used for these
purposes, it is to be seen throughout a large portion of
the world. The horse-shoe is most commonly placed
over the entrance-doors of dwellings; but stables likewise
are thought to be effectually protected by it, for
“witches were dreadful harriers of horse-flesh.” In
William Henderson’s “Folk-Lore of the Northern
Countries of England” we read of a Durham farmer
who was convinced that one of his horses had been ridden
by hags, as he had found it bathed in sweat of a
morning. But after he took the precaution to nail a
horse-shoe over the stable-door, and also to hang some
broom above the manger, the witches had not been able
to indulge in clandestine rides on his horses. While
many an honest fellow in England and elsewhere is a
firm believer in witches and magical horse-shoes, very
few of them can give plausible reasons therefor.</p>

<p>The Lancashire farmer thinks that mischievous fairies
not only ride horses by night, but drive cows out of the
barn, steal the butter, and eat up the children’s porridge;
so he, too, affixes horse-shoes to his buildings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Any one visiting the hamlets of Oxfordshire can
hardly fail to notice the numerous horse-shoes affixed
to the picturesque thatched-roofed cottages; and the
countryfolk in this neighborhood are not always content
with <em>one</em> of these popular safeguards, for two or
three of them are often to be seen on the walls of a
dwelling, invariably placed with the prongs downward.</p>

<p>In Brand’s “Popular Antiquities” (vol. iii. p. 19, 1888)
may be found a clipping from the Cambridge (Eng.)
“Advertiser,” which relates that one Bartingale, a carpenter
and resident of Ely, suspected a woman named
Gotobed of having bewitched him, and of being the
cause of an illness which he had recently had. Thereupon,
at a consultation of matrons of the neighborhood
held in his chamber, it was decided that the most efficient
means of protecting him from the evil influence
of the suspected sorceress was to have three horse-shoes
fastened to the door. A blacksmith was accordingly
summoned, and</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>an operation to this effect was performed, much to the anger
of the supposed witch, who at first complained to the Dean,
but was laughed at by his reverence. She then rushed in
wrath to the sick man’s room, and, miraculous to tell, passed
the Rubicon in spite of the horse-shoes. But this wonder
ceased when it was discovered that Vulcan had substituted
donkeys’ shoes.</p>

</div>

<p>Miss Georgiana F. Jackson says, in “Shropshire Folk-Lore,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
that, in the home of her childhood at Edgmond,
the stable-door was decorated with three rows of horse-shoes
arranged in the form of a triangle; and the
grooms used to say that they were placed there to
exclude witches.</p>

<p>In this region, too, an old horse-shoe placed above
the door of a bedroom is a preventive of the nightmare.</p>

<p>In Shrewsbury, the ancient county town of Shropshire,
horse-shoe talismans are to be seen not only
above the house-doors, but also on the barges which
navigate the river Severn.</p>

<p>In quite recent times a case has been reported of a
poor girl of Whatfield, in Suffolk, who had experienced
a long illness, during which she was visited daily by an
old woman who appeared to be very solicitous as to her
welfare. At length the girl’s family began to suspect
that this old woman was none other than a witch; they
therefore caused a horse-shoe to be fastened to the sill
of the outer door. The precaution was successful, so
runs the tale, for the reputed witch could never thereafter
cross the threshold, and the girl speedily recovered
her health.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>Aubrey, in his “Remains of Gentilisme,” describes
the horse-shoe as a preservative against the mischief or
power of witches, attributing its magical properties to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the astrological principle that Mars, the God of War
and the War Horse, was an enemy of Saturn, who according
to a mediæval idea was the liege lord of
witches.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>During the witchcraft excitement in Scotland, one
Elizabeth Bathcat was indicted for having a horse-shoe
attached to the door of her house “as a devilish means
of instruction from the Devil to make her goods and
all her other affairs to prosper and succeed well.”<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>According to an old legend St. Dunstan, the versatile
English ecclesiastic of the tenth century, who
was a skilled farrier and the owner of a forge, was
requested by the Devil to shoe his “single hoof.”
Dunstan, who recognized his customer, acceded, but
during the operation he caused the Devil so much pain
that the latter begged him to desist. The request was
heeded on condition that the Devil should never enter
a place where a horse-shoe was displayed.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> The popular
belief is that his Satanic Majesty has always faithfully
kept the contract, and quite naturally all lesser
evil spirits have followed his example.</p>

<p>In Scotland, even as late as the beginning of the
nineteenth century, the peasantry believed that witches
were able to draw milk from all the cattle in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
neighborhood, by tugging at a hair-rope in imitation of
the act of milking. Such a rope was made of hairs
from the tails of several cows, whose exact number
was indicated by knots in the rope. While tugging
at the rope the witches repeated either the following
or a similar charm:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Cow’s milk and mare’s milk,</div>
<div class="verse">And every beast that bears milk,</div>
<div class="verse">Between St. Johnstone’s and Dundee,</div>
<div class="verse">Come a’ to me, come a’ to me.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The only adequate protection from such mischievous
pranks as these was afforded by nailing a horse-shoe to
the byre-door and tying sprigs of rowan with a red
thread to the cow’s tail. If, however, these precautions
were neglected, the guilty witch might yet be discovered
by placing the “gudeman’s breeks” upon the
cow’s horns, a leg upon either horn; and thereupon
the animal, being let loose, was sure to run directly to
the witch’s house.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>In many places, certain houses continue even at the
present time to have an evil reputation as harborers of
witches and goblins. In these cases it seems probable
that the owners or occupants of such dwellings neglected
to avail themselves of the immunity afforded
by horse-shoes and other safeguards. For no one, we
believe, has ever seriously maintained that evil spirits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
who are once firmly domiciled, can be easily expelled.
Familiarity with their surroundings may breed a contempt
for amulets. Certain it is, however, that an
ounce or two of iron by way of prevention is worth a
pound or more of cure. When a dwelling is demoniacally
possessed, the devils must be driven out somehow,
and for this purpose recourse is had to exorcisms, and
to religious or magical ceremonies. In the words of
the poet Dryden (“Wife of Bath’s Tale,” i. 28):—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And friars that through the wealthy regions run</div>
<div class="verse">Resort to farmers rich, and bless their halls,</div>
<div class="verse">And exorcise the beds and cross the walls.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In “Antiquitates Vulgares,” by Henry Browne
(1725), the writer gives elaborate directions as to the
proper mode of exorcising a haunted dwelling, and
says that the house which is reported to be vexed with
spirits shall be visited by a priest daily for a week, appropriate
prayers and scriptural selections being read.
Sometimes magical procedures supplanted religious
exercises, and experts in sorcery were employed to rid
a mansion of its undesirable tenants. The following
advertisement from a London newspaper of 1777 may
be appropriately given here:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Haunted Houses.</span>—Whereas there are mansions and castles
in England and Wales which for many years have been
uninhabited, and are now falling into decay, by their being

for unknown reasons are rendered miserable, even in the grave,
a gentleman who has made the tour of Europe, of a particular
turn of mind, and deeply skilled in the abstruse and sacred
science of exorcism, hereby offers his assistance to any owner
or proprietor of such premises, and undertakes to render the
same free from the visitation of such spirits, be their cause
what it may, and render them tenantable and useful for the

<h3>XIV. THE POSITION OF THE HORSE-SHOE AS A PROTECTOR
OF BUILDINGS</h3>

<p>It has been supposed that the horse-shoe is placed at
the <em>outer</em> entrance to a building because of an ancient
Saxon superstition that witches were unable successfully
to practice their wiles upon persons in the open air.<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
The horse-shoe effectively bars the ingress of witches
and evil spirits, but an entrance once obtained by these
creatures, it is powerless to expel them. Therefore the
horse-shoe within doors loses much of its efficacy, but
is still an emblem of good luck.</p>

<p>Placed on the outside of the door, or above the entrance
of a dwelling, or upon the threshold, the horse-shoe
is easily first among the inveterate foes of witches
and devils generally.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Edward Moor, in his “Oriental Fragments” (p. 455,
London, 1834), relates having once, in company with
a gang of urchins, nailed a donkey-shoe under the
threshold of a poor woman in Suffolk who was suspected
of sorcery. He and his youthful companions
endeavored thus to keep her all night within doors, as
witches cannot cross iron.</p>

<p>An English writer<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> tells of having heard an animated
discussion in the parlor of a London beer-shop
as to whether it were preferable to nail a horse-shoe
<em>behind the door</em> or upon <em>the first doorstep</em>; and instances
of extraordinary good luck were mentioned as
the direct result of the potency of the amulet in each
position.</p>

<p>But there are weighty reasons for the selection of
the front door, or the parts immediately connected with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
it, as the proper place for the display of horse-shoes as
household guardians.</p>

<p>In the earliest historic times, and in primitive communities,
the entrance of a dwelling was considered a
sacred place; and in the opinion of eminent scholars
who have made a study of the subject, the threshold
was the first family altar. A peculiar reverence for
the doorway and threshold prevails to-day in many
parts of the world, as is evident from the numerous
ceremonial rites in vogue among widely separated savage
tribes and uncivilized peoples.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Indeed, the custom
of placing amulets and charms in and about the
entrance-doors of houses, stables, and other buildings
is almost universal. In Russia a cross is marked on
the threshold to keep witches away. In Lithuania,
when a house is being built, a wooden cross, or
some article which has been handed down from past
generations, is placed under the threshold. There,
also, when a newly baptized child is being brought
back from church, it is customary for its father to
hold it for a while over the threshold, “so as to place
the new member of the family under the protection of
the domestic divinities.” Sick children who are supposed
to have been afflicted by an evil eye are washed
on the threshold of their cottage, in order that with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the help of the Penates who reside there, the malady
may be driven out of doors.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>Under the threshold of the Assyrian palaces at
Nineveh were found certain images of grotesque monsters,
as, for example, a human form with the head of
a lynx, and a lion’s body with a man’s head, which
were intended as tutelary deities.<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>John Netten Radcliffe, in his “Fiends, Ghosts, and
Sprites” (p. 43, London, 1854), says that the horse-shoe
superstition is a remnant or relic of the worship of
household guardians or divinities,—a practice still in
vogue among the natives of Ashantee, and also among
the Bhutas of Hindostan. In some English counties,
naturally perforated stones are hung behind the door;
and in Glamorganshire the walls of the houses are
whitewashed in order to terrify wandering spirits of
evil. Whether successful or not for this purpose, the
custom is certainly effective as a destroyer of the demoniac
germs of certain diseases.</p>

<p>The French Canadians are not the least superstitious
of mankind, neither do they wholly neglect to take due
precautions against the admittance to their homes of
evil spirits.</p>

<p>They do not answer “Entrez!” when a knock is heard
at the door, but call out “Ouvrez!” This custom is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
said to have originated from a current tradition regarding
a young woman who once answered “Entrez!” in
response to a knock, whereupon the Devil promptly
came in and carried her away.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Where such legends
find open-mouthed credence, it does not appear strange
that horse-shoes and other talismans should be at a
premium.</p>

<p>In Tuscany magical medicines are taken upon the
threshold, which also plays an important part in sorcery.
One reason assigned for this fact is that the
threshold forms the line separating the outer world,
where demons are rampant, from the domestic precincts,
where human beings dwell.</p>

<p>One writer affirms it to be a fixed law in demonology
that spirits cannot cross the threshold and enter a house
unless previously invited to do so, but adds that there
are many exceptions to this rule.<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> The weight of evidence
does not support this view, for mischievous
fairies and witches are known to rudely disregard the
laws of etiquette, and do not wait for an invitation
to enter dwellings. This fact is, indeed, a chief <i lang="fr">raison
d’être</i> for the use of talismans at the entrance of
habitations.</p>

<p>The residents of the beautiful Thuringian Forest
region, in whose neighborhood these lines chanced to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
penned, are wont to affix horse-shoes to the thresholds
of their chamber-doors, lest some rude goblin enter
and disturb their slumbers. But the fastidiousness of
these sylvan folk is not content with an ordinary shoe,
even though found on the road and venerable with rust;
in order to serve its purpose as a talisman, a Thuringian
horse-shoe must have been forged by a bachelor
of wholesome life and good character, on Saint John’s
Eve.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>In German households, the horse-shoe over the door
is believed to afford protection against divers apparitions,
as well as against the Devil, witchcraft, lightning,
sickness, and evils of every sort.</p>

<p>The cross, symbol of the Christian faith, is the most
potent of all talismans, but is seldom seen at the entrance
of dwellings. In some Roman Catholic countries
the crucifix is, indeed, everywhere conspicuous,
not only in churches and shrines, but by the roadside,
in fields, and on the outer walls of houses, but it is
rarely placed at the front door. In Hungary, however,
the Magyars mark with black chalk the figure of
a cross upon their stable-doors, and also brand anew
thereon the sacred emblem each year at Christmas
time.</p>

<p>The respect paid by the inhabitants of Tibet to their
household divinities somewhat resembles the worship of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
their <i lang="la">Lares</i> by the Romans of old, and finds a parallel
in the honor accorded to the favorite amulet of Western
civilization, the horse-shoe.</p>

<p>The Tibetans set up above the entrances of their
houses complex talismans, composed of various mystical
objects, such as a ram’s skull with horns attached, having
displayed along the base of the skull pieces of
carved wood representing a man and woman, a house,
and other symbols; the idea being to deceive the
demons, and to make them believe that these objects
are the real dwelling and its inmates. The Tibetans
believe that the demons are thus tricked, and that the
wooden images are the victims of their mischievous
designs.<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>Far away among the nomadic tribes of Turkestan,
horse-shoes are occasionally seen nailed to the thresholds
of dwellings in the vicinity of the ancient city of
Merv; and within doors, near the entrances of these
peculiar habitations, which resemble mammoth parrot
cages, pieces of linen or calico, four or five inches
square, are seen upon the felt wall-lining, to serve as
receptacles for the free-will offerings of such wandering
spirits as may pass the magic barriers of the horse-shoes.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>In some regions there still prevails a time-honored
custom of placing over the chief entrances of dwellings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
inscriptions, embodying usually a religious thought or
exhortation. Sometimes, however, the sentence commends
the house and its occupants to the care of the
goddess Fortune, thus having a significance akin to that
of the horse-shoe symbol. In the year 1892 the writer
copied many inscriptions found above the doors of
houses in northern Italy and Switzerland, some of them
being written in Latin, others in German, French, Italian,
and the Romansch dialect, current in the Engadine.
Here, for example, is one from a house in the
Swiss village of Bergun, the original being in German:
“This house is in God’s hand; May Good Luck come
in, and Bad Luck stay out! 1673.”</p>

<p>Many of these inscriptions are Biblical verses, which
are here used as talismans, just as the pious Moslem
employs sentences from the Koran.</p>

<p>Here, again, is the translation of a German sentence
over the door of a dwelling in the village of Ober-Schönberg,
near Innsbruck, Tyrol, copied in 1897:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>All persons entering this house are recommended to Divine
protection. God and the Virgin Mary guard all such, even
though powerful enemies threaten, and lightnings and thunder
rage without!</p>

</div>

<p>Above the door of a house in the village of Welschnofen,
near Botzen, the wayfarer may read the following
sentence: “Pray for us, holy Florian, that fire may
not harm our dwelling.” Above the inscription an eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
is painted, while below is a realistic picture of Saint
Florian, the protector of buildings against fire, engaged
in pouring water on a burning roof.</p>

<p>The Bassamese, inhabitants of the Gold Coast of
Africa, west of Ashantee, use certain fetich objects for
the protection of their dwellings. These amulets,
which are often merely pieces of wood painted red, or
fragments of pottery, are placed upon the doors of
their huts, and are believed to afford ample protection
against thieves.<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> Such a fetich is probably intended
to exclude evil spirits as well, and is, therefore, a
substitute for both the horse-shoe and the watch-dog,
those guardians of the household so popular in civilized
communities.</p>

<p>When a modern Egyptian returns from a pilgrimage
to Mecca, he fastens above the entrance of his house
a branch of the aloe, which is not only a proof of his
religious zeal in having accomplished the holy journey,
but is also reckoned a protection against objectionable
spiritual intruders, and is, therefore, seen in Cairo over
the doors of the houses both of Christians and Jews.</p>

<p>In northern Scotland, formerly, a branch of the rowan-tree
was placed over a farmhouse door, after having
been waved while the words “Avaunt, Satan!” were
solemnly pronounced.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>About the year 1850 the Rev. Andrew A. Bonar,
who was then assistant minister in Collace Parish, Perthshire,
Scotland, found the custom of displaying horse-shoes
on the doors of farm buildings so prevalent that
he thought it his duty to remonstrate against a practice
savoring of paganism. But his efforts in this
direction, though hardly crowned with success, were
yet not wholly without avail, for his superstitious
parishioners removed the guardian horse-shoes from
the outsides of the doors, and nailed them up on the
insides.<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>The <i lang="fr">raison d’être</i> of the horse-shoe at the entrance
of shops and other frequented buildings has been attributed
to a belief that, among the many people continually
passing through the doorway, some one might,
unobserved, bring in ill-luck or work mischief. But
these safeguards not only form a sufficient barrier
against obnoxious hags and sorcerers, but are potent
against ghosts and all manner of evil creatures. When
the Oxford undergraduate “sports his oak” to prevent
the untimely entrance of dunning tradespeople, he shuts
out friendly visitors as well; but the faithful horse-shoe,
by a process of natural selection, debars only
objectionable spirits, and is a formidable obstacle to the
demon of ill-luck.</p>

<h3>XV. THE LUCKY HORSE-SHOE IN GENERAL</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>He laughs like a boor who has found a horse-shoe.—<cite>Dutch proverb.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Throughout Germany the belief obtains that a horse-shoe
found on the road, and nailed on the threshold of
a house with the points directed outward, is a mighty
protection not only against hags and fiends, but also
against fire and lightning; but, <em>reversed</em>, it brings misfortune.
In eastern Pennsylvania, however, even in
recent times, the horse-shoe is often placed with the
prongs pointing inward, so that the luck may be spilled
into the house. The horse-shoe retains its potency as
a charm on the sea as well as on land, and it has long
been a practice among sailors to nail this favorite amulet
against the mast of a vessel, whether fishing-boat or
large sea-going craft, as a protection against the Evil
One. The shoe of a “wraith-horse,” the mythical offspring
of a water-stallion, is especially esteemed by
Scotch mariners for this purpose.<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>In Bohemia only exists the superstition exactly opposite
to that elsewhere prevalent, namely, that whoever
picks up a horse-shoe thereby <i lang="la">ipso facto</i> picks
up ill-luck for himself,—a notable example in folk-lore
of the exception which proves the rule. The Bohemians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
however, believe a nailed-up horse-shoe to be a
cure for lunacy.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>As a general rule, the degree of luck pertaining to
a horse-shoe found by chance has been thought to
depend on the number of nails remaining in it: the
more nails the more luck.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>In Northumberland the holes free of nails are carefully
counted, as these indicate, presumably in years,
how soon the finder of the shoe may expect to be
married.<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> The peasants of northern Portugal prefer
mule-shoes having an uneven number of nail-holes,
as counteractives of the evil influences of the dreaded,
omnipresent witches known as the <i>Bruxas</i>.<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>In Derbyshire it is customary to drive a horse-shoe,
prongs upward, between two flagstones near the
door of a dwelling.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> This position is sometimes explained
by saying that, so placed, the luck cannot spill
out.</p>

<p>In a short poem called “The Lucky Horse-Shoe,”
by James T. Fields, an amusing account is given of a
farmer who picked up an old horse-shoe from the road,
and nailed it upon the door of his barn with the prongs
downward. But, far from bringing him luck, Fortune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
thereafter frowned upon him; his hay crop failed, a
drought blighted his vegetables, and his hens refused
to lay.</p>

<p>The good farmer, discouraged and perplexed, confided
his woes to the sympathetic ear of an aged wayfarer
who chanced to pass by, relating how misfortunes
had pursued him since he had fastened up the old
horse-shoe.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The stranger asked to see the shoe;</div>
<div class="verse">The farmer brought it into view;</div>
<div class="verse">But when the old man raised his head,</div>
<div class="verse">He laughed outright and quickly said:</div>
<div class="verse">“No wonder skies upon you frown,</div>
<div class="verse">You’ve nailed the horse-shoe upside down;</div>
<div class="verse">Just turn it round, and soon you’ll see</div>
<div class="verse">How you and Fortune will agree.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The farmer profited by the friendly suggestion and
reversed his luck-token, whereupon the capricious goddess
fairly beamed upon him. His barn was soon filled
with hay, his storehouses were packed with the kindly
fruits of the earth, while his wife presented him with
twins.</p>

<p>Farmers may well take heed <em>how</em> they nail up horse-shoes
over the doors of their barns. To obtain the best
results, it would seem advisable to place a pair of these
useful articles on each farm building, one with the
points upward, the other reversed; for in this way
they may not only hope to win Fortune’s smiles, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
also to keep all witches and unfriendly spirits at a
respectful distance.</p>

<p>In an interesting story for children in “St. Nicholas,”
April, 1897, by Rudolph F. Bunner, entitled “The
Horse-Shoe of Luck,” the writer introduces Luck in
the character and garb of a wandering clown or jester,
mounted upon a white horse. This jovial traveler seeks
a night’s lodging at a wayside farmhouse, and when he
has almost reached its hospitable door, his steed casts a
shoe, which the farmer hastens to pick up and carefully
hangs on a hook above the door. Luck proved to be a
most amusing fellow, and after supper he entertained
the children of the household in a royal manner, showing
them, among other things, how to drop china and
glass without breaking them, and how to tumble down
stairs without getting hurt. So the evening passed
merrily enough, and all retired for the night in a happy
frame of mind. Early in the morning the farmer was
awakened by the splash of raindrops upon his face, and,
hastily arising, he discovered that the roof had sprung
a leak, and that his guest had unceremoniously departed.
Nettled by such conduct, the farmer and his family hastened
in pursuit of the fleeing stranger, guided by the
hoof-prints of his white horse; and when they had overtaken
him, the farmer reproached his late guest for
having left his house so abruptly. Whereupon Luck
replied: “I left you, not because you could not even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
nail my horse-shoe over your door, but hung it upside
down, so the luck ran out at the ends, but because of
your own mistake. You trusted to me; you trusted to
Luck. Ah ha!”</p>

<p>In the northernmost districts of Scotland exists a
belief that if the first shoe put on the foot of a stallion
be hung on the byre door, no harm will come near the
cows; and in the same region, if a horse-shoe be placed
between the houses of quarrelsome neighbors, neither
incurs any risk of evil as a result of the other’s ill-wishes.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>As a means of warding off impending sickness from
cattle, and in order that they may thrive during the
summer, the Transylvanian peasants place broken horse-shoes
in the animals’ drinking-troughs on St. John’s
Day, June 24.</p>

<p>In Lincolnshire, not many years ago, there prevailed
a custom of “charming” ash-trees by burying horse-shoes
under them. Twigs from a tree thus magically
endowed were believed to be efficacious in curing cattle
over which a shrewmouse had run, or which had been
exposed to the glance of an evil eye. To effect a cure
in such cases, it was only necessary to gently stroke the
affected animal with one of these twigs.<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>Some years ago, a Golspie fisherman who owned a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
small boat was favored with an extraordinary run of
luck in his fishing, and as a result of his good fortune
was enabled to buy a larger vessel, selling the old one
to a neighbor. From that time, however, his lucky star
seemed to wane, and good “catches” were infrequent.
Casting about in his mind for the reason of this, he
bethought him of a stallion’s shoe which was fastened
inside his former boat, and which had been given
him by a “wise person.” But both boat and horse-shoe
were now in the hands of his neighbor, who maintained
with reason that the lucky token was now <em>his</em>
property, as he had purchased “the boat and its gear.”
And ever thereafter the disconsolate fisherman attributed
his lack of success in that season to his own folly
in having parted with the stallion’s shoe.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>The horse-shoe figures often in traditions of the sea
as a protection to sailors. When the ghostly ship of
the Flying Dutchman meets another vessel, some of its
uncanny crew approach the latter in a boat and beg
them to take charge of a packet of letters.</p>

<p>These letters must be nailed to the mast, else some
misfortune will overtake the ship; especially if there be
no Bible on board, nor any horse-shoe fastened to the
foremast.</p>

<p>In the month of September, 1825, lightning struck a
brigantine which lay at anchor in the Bay of Armiso,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
in the Adriatic. A sailor was killed by the bolt, and
tradition says that on one of his hips was seen the perfect
representation of a horse-shoe, a counterpart of one
nailed to the vessel’s foremast in accordance with the
custom in vogue on the Mediterranean.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>The same custom is common in German inland waters,
as, for example, on the river craft which ply on the
Elbe below Hamburg, and on those which navigate the
Trave, at Lubec. On the latter vessels horse-shoes are
usually fastened to the stern-post, instead of to the
mast.</p>

<p>In a German work, entitled “Seespuk,” by P. G.
Heims, page 138, the writer remarks that, among seafaring
people, the old pagan emblem, the horse-shoe,
whose talismanic origin is so closely associated with
horse-sacrifice and the use of horse-flesh as food among
the heathen nations of the North, is even now the most
powerful safeguard aboard ship against lightning and
the powers of evil.</p>

<p>There are comparatively few small vessels laden with
wood, fruit, vegetables, or other merchandise, sailing
between Baltic Sea ports, upon whose foremast, or elsewhere
upon deck, horse-shoes are not nailed.</p>

<p>Indeed, continues the same writer, this symbol has a
notable significance in German art as well, a fact attributable
less to its graceful curving shape than to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
deeply rooted superstitions, relics of barbaric times,
which yet cling to it.</p>

<p>Whether we regard the horse-shoe as a symbol of
Wodan, the chief deity of the northern nations, as
deriving magical power from its half-moon shape, as a
product of supernatural skill in dealing with iron and
fire, or as appertaining to the favorite sacrificial animal
of antiquity, the pagan source of its superstitious use
is equally evident.</p>

<p>The horse-shoe, whether as an amulet or as a sign of
good luck, has nothing to do with the Christian religion.
In either case it is a wholly superstitious symbol, and
savors of paganism; it is in fact an inheritance from
our heathen ancestors, a barbaric token, unworthy
even to be named in connection with the sacred cross.
Yet throughout many centuries it has captivated the
popular fancy, and its emblematic use appears to be as
firmly established to-day as ever in many parts of the
world.</p>

<p>It is popularly believed that the chance finding of a
horse-shoe greatly enhances its magical power; and it
is claimed, moreover, by some writers, to be an axiom
in folk-lore that talismanic objects thrust upon one’s
notice, as it were, are direct gifts from the goddess
Fortune, and hence possessed of a special value for the
finder. Such a notion is as clearly of pagan origin as
the custom of bowing to the new moon, or of fixing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
representations of horses’ heads upon the gables of
houses in order to terrify wandering spirits of evil.</p>

<p>In “Curiosities of Popular Customs,” by William S.
Walsh (p. 665, 1898), it is stated that the Northern
peoples were wont to offer sacrifices to Wodan after the
harvest, and that the little cakes still baked on St.
Martin’s Day, November 11, throughout Germany, are
shaped like a horn or horse-shoe, which was a token of
the pagan god. Although not susceptible of proof, it
seems highly probable that we have here another relic
of idolatry. It is a point worthy of note, moreover,
that Wodan was not only an all-powerful deity, corresponding
to the Greek Zeus and Roman Jupiter, but
that he was also a great magician, and hence quite
naturally the horse-shoe, as one of his symbols, inherits
magical attributes.</p>

<p>In Tuscany a horse-shoe when found is placed in a
small red bag with some hay, which the Tuscans consider
also a luck-bringing article, and the twofold charm
is kept in its owner’s bed.<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Robert James, an English physician of the eighteenth
century, and the inventor of a well-known fever-powder,
ascribed his success in acquiring a fortune to
his good luck in having once found a horse-shoe on
Westminster Bridge. The sincerity of his faith was
attested by the adoption of the horse-shoe as his family
crest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Brand quotes from John Bell’s MS. “Discourse on
Witchcraft” (1705) as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Guard against devilish charms for Men or Beasts. There
are many sorceries practiced in our day, against which I
would on this occasion bear my testimony, and do therefore
seriously ask you, what is it you mean by your observation of
Times and Seasons as lucky or unlucky? What mean you
by your many Spells, Verses, Words, so often repeated, said
fasting or going backward? How mean you to have success
by carrying about with you certain Herbs, Plants, and branches
of Trees? Why is it that, fearing certain events, you do use
such superstitious means to prevent them, by laying bits of
Timber at Doors, carrying a Bible merely for a Charm, without
any farther use of it? What intend ye by opposing
Witchcraft to Witchcraft, in such sort that, when ye suppose
one to be bewitched, ye endeavour his Relief by Burnings,
Bottles, Horse-shoes, and such like magical ceremonies?</p>

<p>In some Roman Catholic countries the priests are
wont to brand cows and pigs on the forehead with the
mark of a horse-shoe, to insure them against disease.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>
It was, moreover, an old Scotch superstition, or <i>freet</i>,
to pass a horse-shoe thrice beneath the belly and over
the back of a cow that was considered elf-shot.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>Among the Wendish inhabitants of the <i lang="de">Spreewald</i>,
in North Germany, the lucky finder of a horse-shoe is
careful not to tell any neighbor of his good fortune,
but proceeds at once to fasten the shoe over the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
of his house, or on the threshold, with three nails, and
by three blows of a hammer, so that evil spirits may
not enter.</p>

<p>We have seen that a horse-shoe picked up on the
road is often prized as no mean acquisition by the finder
thereof. It may not be out of place to give here a literal
translation of a spell for the protection of a horse’s
hoof when a shoe has been lost. The original appeared
in Mone’s “Anzeiger” in 1834, and is written in the
dialect known as “Middle High German,” which was
in vogue from the twelfth to the sixteenth centuries:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>When a horse has lost one of its iron shoes, take a bread-knife
and incise the hoof at the edge from one heel to the
other, and lay the knife crosswise on the sole and say: “I
command thee, hoof and horn, that thou breakest as little as
God the Lord broke his Word, when he created heaven and
earth.” And thou shalt say these words three hours in succession,
and five <cite>Paternosters</cite> and five <cite>Ave Marias</cite> to the
praise of the Virgin. Then the horse will not walk lame
until thou happenest to reach a smithy.</p>

</div>

<p>The Germans have a saying in regard to a young
girl who has been led astray,—“She has lost a horse-shoe.”
This saying has been associated with the shoe
as a symbol of marriage, an idea found both in the
northern and Indian mythologies. But the phrase has
been also thought to refer to the horse-shoe shaped
<i lang="la">gloria</i> which crowns the head of the Virgin, the horse-shoe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
thus becoming the symbol of maidenly chastity.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>
Again, it has been suggested, in reference to the same
phrase, that the horse-shoe is a symbol of the V (or first
letter of the word <em>Virgo</em>), which is used in church records
to designate the unmarried state, just as the word “spinster”
is used in legal documents.</p>

<p>The ancient Irish were wont to hang up in their
houses the feet and legs of their deceased steeds, setting
an especial value upon the hoofs;<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> and with the Chinese
of to-day a horse’s hoof hung up indoors is supposed
to have the same protective influence over a
dwelling that a horse-shoe has elsewhere. In southwestern
Germany it is still a common practice to nail a
hoof over the stable-door; and in the Netherlands a
horse’s foot placed in a stable is thought to keep the
horses from being bewitched.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>Burton, in his “Anatomy of Melancholy,” admits a
belief in the virtues of a ring made from the hoof of the
right foot of an ass, when carried about as an amulet.</p>

<p>Occasionally, though rarely, the horse-shoe is thought
to have been employed by the witches themselves in
furtherance of their mischievous designs.</p>

<p>In the “Revue des traditions populaires,” vol. ii.
1887, an anecdote is related of a veteran Polish cavalryman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
who had served under Napoleon I. While bivouacking
with a detachment of lancers in a village of
eastern Prussia, he and several others lodged in the
house of an old peasant woman, and their horses were
accommodated in her barn. It was shortly noticed that
the animals appeared depressed and refused the hay
and grain provided for them, whereupon the soldiers
concluded that they were under some spell and began a
search for the cause. They soon found an old horse-shoe
with three nails remaining in it, and one of these
was quickly driven out with a hammer. Instantly the
horses began to snort and exhibited signs of restlessness.
On the removal of the second nail they held up
their heads proudly, and when the third nail was hammered
out they fell upon their provender and devoured
it voraciously. The cavalrymen were now convinced
that their horses had been the victims of some deviltry
at the hands of their hostess, whom they believed to be
a sorceress. Before their departure, therefore, they
gave her a good beating with their sabre scabbards to
teach her not to practice her nefarious arts upon the
horses of honest people.</p>

<h3>XVI. THE HORSE-SHOE AS A PHALLIC SYMBOL</h3>

<p>It will suffice merely to allude to the theory of the
phallic origin of the superstitious use of the horse-shoe,
a branch of our subject capable of much elaboration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
The horse-shoe is still the conventional figure for the
<i>yoni</i> (a phallic emblem) in modern Hindu temples.
This theory is discussed in “Ancient Faiths embodied
in Ancient Names,” by Thomas Inman, M. D., London,
1873; and in “A Discourse on the Worship of Priapus,”
by Richard Payne Knight, Esq., London, 1865.</p>

<p>Phallic ornaments are of great antiquity, and amulets
of this character have been found in the earliest Etruscan
tombs. Specimens are also to be seen in the various
Italian museums.</p>

<p>The <i>yoni</i> symbol guards the entrances of ancient
temples in Mexico and Peru, as well as in India.</p>

<p>Ornate Mexican sacred stones of the horse-shoe form,
relics of the ancient Maya tribes, are classed in the
National Museum at Washington, D. C., as representative
of fecundity and nature-worship; and horse-shoe
symbols are found in Aztec manuscripts relating to
agriculture as signs of abundance.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>Phallic charms are seen above the entrances of houses
and over tent-doors in north Africa to avert the evil eye,
and to bring health and good fortune. Much information
on this subject may be found in a chapter on serpent
and phallic worship in “Rivers of Life,” by Major-General
J. G. R. Forlong, London, 1883; and in an
essay on “Phallism in Ancient Religions,” by C.
Staniford Wake, 1888.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>On a curious tablet found near a prehistoric mound
in the vicinity of the village of Cahokia, Saint Clair
County, Illinois, are portrayed human faces with bird-like
profiles, diamond-shaped eyes, and low foreheads
surmounted by ornamental crowns or head-dresses.
The mouths are wide open, and in front of them are
represented symbols having a well-defined horse-shoe
form. These symbols, although probably of phallic
origin, are thought to signify the principle of life
residing in the breath, just as in India the horse-shoe
is an emblem of the soul.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<h3>XVII. THE HORSE-SHOE AS A SYMBOL ON TAVERN
SIGN-BOARDS</h3>

<p>The horse-shoe, associated usually with some other
symbol, is not infrequently seen displayed on the signs
of British taverns. There is a well-known hostelry
bearing this sign and name on Tottenham Court Road
in London. To quote from “The History of Signboards,”
by Jacob Larwood and John Camden Hotten:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>The Three Horse-shoes</i> are not uncommon, and the single
shoe may be met with in many combinations, arising from the
old belief in its lucky influences. Thus the <i>Horse and Horse-Shoe</i>
was the sign of William Warden at Dover, as appears
from his token. The <i>Sun and Horse-Shoe</i> is still a public-house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
sign in Great Tichfield Street, and the <i>Magpie and
Horse-Shoe</i> may be seen carved in Fetter Lane; the magpie is
perched within the horse-shoe, a bunch of grapes being suspended
from it. The <i>Horns and Horse-shoe</i> is represented
on the token of William Grainge, in Gutter Lane, 1666, a
horse-shoe within a pair of antlers. The <i>Hoop and Horse-shoe</i>
on Tower Hill was formerly called the <i>Horse-shoe</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>Miller Christy, in his book “The Trade Signs of
Essex,” says that horse-shoe signs probably owe their
origin partly to the fact that this symbol appears on
the arms of the Farriers’ Company, and partly to the old
practice of fastening a horse-shoe upon the stable-door
or elsewhere as a witch-scarer. In the county of Essex
the horse-shoe may be seen upon the signs of beer-houses
at Great Parndon, Braintree, Waltham Abbey,
and High Ongar.</p>

<p>There was formerly more than one noted inn in London
known as the Half-Moon, and a street of that
name, leading from Piccadilly, is well known. The
name and symbol of the <em>full</em> moon, however, seldom
appear on sign-boards. Butler asks in “Hudibras:”—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Tell me, but what’s the nat’ral cause,</div>
<div class="verse">Why on a sign no painter draws</div>
<div class="verse">The full moon, but the half?</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The reason is doubtless because of the favorable
auspices associated from time immemorial with the
crescent moon.</p>

<p>One need hardly accept as plausible the explanation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
sometimes offered, namely, that the half-moon tavern
symbol is a silent invitation to eat and drink to one’s
full capacity; a hint, as it were, to follow the crescent
moon’s example and “get full.”</p>

<h3>XVIII. HORSE-SHOES ON CHURCH-DOORS</h3>

<p>The origin of the horse-shoe as a charm has been
ascribed to its resemblance to the metallic aureole or
<i lang="la">meniscus</i> formerly placed over the heads of images of
patron saints in churches, and which is also represented
in ancient pictures of the Virgin.</p>

<p>This aureole, or more properly <i lang="la">nimbus</i>, was probably
of pagan origin, for in early times circles of stars frequently
ornamented the heads of statues of the gods,
as emblematic of divinity. In speaking of certain
ancient relics found in Ireland, Mr. W. G. Wood-Martin
(“Pagan Ireland,” p. 492) says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Thin crescentic plates, with the extremities terminating in
flat circular disks, are the ornaments most frequently discovered.
In form they are identical with the half-moonshaped
ornaments in use among the Greeks and Romans, and
with the <i lang="la">nimbi</i> on carvings of the Byzantine school; and they
differ but little from the ring which now is conventionally
placed around the head of a saint. Thus this glory can be
traced back to pagandom. The crescentic plate appears to
have been primarily the badge of some distinguished person, a
chief or king; then it became the emblem of one considered
to be a very holy person, for in Ireland, in the early days of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Christianity, the saints were derived principally from the
aristocracy.</p>

</div>

<p>In the collection of the Royal Irish Academy is a
golden tiara or diadem, said to have been found in
County Clare. This relic, which measures about a foot
in height and the same in breadth, is thought to have
been a head-dress of some pagan or early Christian
chieftain.</p>

<p>In the earlier years of the church these crescent symbols
were avoided as savoring of heathenism; but without
any thought of its significance, it became customary in
the Middle Ages to place a circular brass plate upon the
heads of statues as a protection from snow or rain.
Hence arose the practice of similarly adorning images
and paintings in churches.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>In later times these crescent-shaped pieces of metal
were sometimes nailed up at the entrance of churches,
and so came to be regarded as protective emblems.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
The horse-shoe was an easily available substitute for the
halo or glory, and so was often placed upon the doors
of churches, especially in the southwest of England, as
it was generally believed in olden times that evil spirits
could enter even consecrated edifices. Aubrey, in his
“Miscellanies,” mentions having seen under the porch
of Staninfield Church, in Suffolk, an inscription with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
device of a horse-shoe, intended to exclude witches, and
he naïvely remarks that one would imagine holy water
amply sufficient for the purpose.</p>

<p>On the south door of the parish church of Ashby-Foville,
in Leicestershire, were formerly two ancient
horse-shoes of great size, one of them measuring 16 by
11½ inches, or more than twice as large as an average
modern shoe.</p>

<p>As it does not seem likely that such shoes were made
to fit horses’ feet, in the absence of traditional information
regarding them, it appears probable that they
were intended solely to bar the ingress of witches.<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p>In St. Martin’s Church, Canterbury, the oldest in
England, the sacristan shows visitors the site of an early
English door on the south side, and a Norman doorway
in the middle of the northern wall, both long since
blocked up. Infants to be baptized were formerly
brought into the church by the south entrance, and
after the ceremony the north door was thrown open to
permit the egress of evil spirits expelled by baptism.
For in early times demons were believed to come from
the north, where the habitations of the Norse gods
were also thought to be. The pagans, when worshiping
their deities, looked towards the north; but
Christians engaged in prayer turned their faces eastward
and lifted up their hands; they regarded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
north as “the unblessed heathen quarter.” The unexplored
Arctic regions, where night<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> reigned much of
the time, were thought to belong especially to the Devil,
or spirit of darkness;<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> and the same idea is conveyed
in several passages of Holy Scripture, as, for example,
in Jeremiah iv. 6: “I will bring evil from the north,
and a great destruction.”</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages the rose-windows in the north
and south transepts of Lincoln Minster were called the
two eyes of the cathedral, the former being known as
the <i>Dean’s Eye</i>, ever on the watch against the attacks
of Lucifer, who had his abode “in the sides of the
north” (Isaiah xiv. 13); while the window in the south
transept was called the <i>Bishop’s Eye</i>, “courting the
influence of the Holy Spirit, of which the south wind
was a type.” Apropos of evil spirits entering consecrated
places, there is a quaint legend about a little
stone figure yclept the <i>Lincoln Imp</i>, which is to be
seen perched upon a corbel of a column on the north
side of the Angel Choir of the same cathedral. According
to one version of the legend, when Bishop
Remigius came to Lincoln, in the year after the Norman
Conquest, the Devil was sorely tried; for until
that time he had had undisturbed control of affairs
in the town and neighborhood. In vain the Evil One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
sought to hinder the completion of the church, and
finally he waylaid the bishop outside the building
and attempted to kill him. But the good bishop at
this critical time called upon the Blessed Virgin Mary
for assistance, and she sent a tempest of wind which
so buffeted and distracted the Devil that he sought
refuge inside the church, not daring to venture out
because of the fierce wind, which prevails a good part
of the time even nowadays, and which is still awaiting
the Devil’s reappearance!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The Bishop, we know, died long ago;</div>
<div class="verse">The wind still waits, nor will he go</div>
<div class="verse">Till he has a chance of beating his foe;</div>
<div class="verse">But the Devil hopp’d up without a limp,</div>
<div class="verse">And at once took shape as the Lincoln Imp.</div>
<div class="verse">And there he sits atop the column,</div>
<div class="verse">And grins at the people who gaze so solemn.</div>
<div class="verse">Moreover, he mocks at the wind below,</div>
<div class="verse">And says, “You may wait till doomsday, O!”<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></div>

</div>
</div>

<p>In southern Germany, Bavaria, and Tyrol, the horse-shoe
symbol is to be seen on church-doors, as an emblem
of St. Leonard, the guardian and protector of
horses and travelers; and it is usually associated with
some romantic legend, having oftentimes a historic
basis. Traditions relating to horse-shoes on church-doors
are, indeed, plentiful in the popular literature of
Germany, and a few examples are given later. St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Leonard’s Day, November 6, had its special observances.
The peasants were wont to bring their horses
to some church dedicated to that worthy, and ride them
thrice around the sacred building, a procedure which
was believed to be highly auspicious.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> It was, moreover,
customary for noblemen, before starting on an
equestrian journey, to fasten a horse-shoe on the church-door
as a votive offering to St. Leonard.<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>Especial honor is accorded to this saint on the day
of his festival, at Fischhausen, a seaport village in
northeastern Prussia. On that occasion the parish
church is surrounded by farm wagons and other vehicles
drawn by gayly decorated horses, for here the
country people have a grand rendezvous; young women
in holiday attire drive hither the cows, who have been
brought from their summer quarters in the upland
pastures, that they, too, may participate in the festivities.
A religious service, largely attended by the peasants,
is first held in the church, and then follow the
outdoor exercises, of which a chief feature consists in
driving the horses three times around the building at a
rapid pace.<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>During the prevalence of a severe epizoötic in Würtemberg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
many years ago, the people removed the shoes
from their horses’ feet, and hung them on the walls of
churches as propitiatory offerings. Various other iron
implements, such as chain traces, were thus similarly
displayed.</p>

<p>An ancient St. Leonard’s Chapel, in the town of
Laupheim, is encircled by an iron chain, which is said
to have been forged from horse-shoes thus piously contributed.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
The largest church dedicated to this saint is
at Tölz, in upper Bavaria, and its altar is likewise surrounded
by an iron chain.</p>

<p>Pictures of St. Leonard are sometimes placed upon
stable-doors to bring luck; he is usually represented as
holding a pastoral staff, while on one side is seen a colt
or filly, on the other a sick ox, and at his feet is a ewe
lamb.</p>

<p>In northern Germany, St. George, as a successor
of Wodan, is one of the special guardians and protectors
of horses. On the festal day of this saint, April
23, the peasants gather in large numbers around some
church dedicated to him, and their horses and vehicles,
numbering sometimes many hundreds, are drawn up in
a circle around the sanctuary. After the parish priest
has delivered a sermon in the church, he comes to the
door and blesses each horse separately as the animal is
led past, meanwhile sprinkling him with holy water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Then the young men mount their best horses and ride
them three times at full speed around the church, shouting
lustily meanwhile.</p>

<p>Jähns remarks that this ceremony is doubtless a
relic of some pagan rite, and that in many places a venerable
tree, instead of a Christian church, is chosen as
the place of rendezvous on St. George’s Day. During
the ride around the tree, an aged peasant standing
in its shade throws upon each horse, as it passes, a little
moist earth taken from about the roots of the sacred
tree, and this insures the animal against sickness until
the following spring, especially if some of the earth be
placed in a bag and hung up in the stable.</p>

<p>As the hammer was Thor’s emblem, so the horse-shoe
has been thought to possess a certain mystic significance
as a symbol of the heathen god Wodan; and it
has been assumed that the ancient churches, upon whose
doors horse-shoes are still to be seen, were built upon
the sites of pagan temples dedicated to that deity. It
has been argued, moreover, that the modern use of a
horse-shoe as a talisman, and the placing of horses’
heads on peasants’ houses, are relics of heathendom,
and have a mysterious affinity with the hoof-print
legends of Teutonic mythology. Such a theory appears
plausible enough in view of the fact that many
of the superstitious customs and beliefs of modern times
are known to have existed before the Christian era.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<h3>XIX. HORSE-SHOE LEGENDARY LORE</h3>

<p>1. Within recent years two horse-shoes were to be
seen on the door of the parish church of Haccombe in
Derbyshire. A romantic legend associated with these
horse-shoes is the theme of a ballad supposed to have
been written by a master of Exeter Grammar School
in the early part of the nineteenth century. The ballad
graphically describes a race for a wager between a
certain Earl of Totnes, mounted on a Derbyshire roan,
and one Sir Arthur Champernowne, on a fleet Barbary
courser. The race was won by the earl, who thereupon
rode straight to the door of Haccombe Church,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And there he fell on his knees and prayed,</div>
<div class="verse">And many an <cite>Ave Maria</cite> said;</div>
<div class="verse">Bread and money he gave to the poor,</div>
<div class="verse">And he nailed the roan’s shoes to the chapel door.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>2. In the traditionary lore of the Harz Mountains
there is a weird tale of four horse-shoes, which for ages
were to be seen on the door of a church in the suburbs
of Klettenburg.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, so runs the story, a great drinking-match
was held on a Sunday morning at Elrich. The
prize was a golden chain, and many knights assembled
from near and far. The carousal lasted for some hours,
until Count Ernest of Klettenburg, the only one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
could still keep on his feet, exultantly claimed the
golden chain, which he hung about his neck. Then,
mounting his horse, he rode homeward, and while nearing
Klettenburg he heard the strains of even-song in a
church dedicated to St. Nicholas. Urging on his steed,
he rode madly through the open door straight to the
altar. Then, so runs the legend, the horse’s four shoes
fell off, and horse and rider sank down together out of
sight. In memory of this wonderful event, the four
horse-shoes were placed on the door of the church, and
for many years were regarded with awe by the simple
countryfolk.<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>3. In the construction of the Church of St. Stephen,
at Tangermünde, in Prussian Saxony, a brick edifice
of the fourteenth century, the members of two guilds,
those of the blacksmiths and shoemakers, were of
especial assistance; and in remembrance of this, a
horse-shoe and an iron shoe-sole were built into the
outer wall of the church. The former indicates that
up to its level the blacksmiths had built the walls, and
the latter shows that all the work above the horse-shoe
was done by the shoemakers; such, at least, is the popular
explanation, which may well be received <i lang="la">cum grano
salis</i>.</p>

<p>4. In the parish church of Schwarzenstein, in east
Prussia, hang two horse-shoes as reminders of the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
tradition: In the village of Eichmedien, one
mile from Rastenburg, lived formerly as tavern-keeper
a woman, who had earned an unenviable notoriety by
her practice of charging double the proper fees for
board and lodging. Late one night, when several of
her guests accused her of being a cheat, she asseverated
her honesty by holding up her hand, and saying in the
form of an oath: “If my score is not correct, may
the Devil now jump on my back.” The Evil One took
the woman promptly at her word, transformed her into
a mare, and rode her out of the village, laughing scornfully.
At headlong speed he rode to a blacksmith’s
shop in Schwarzenstein, and demanded that his mare be
shod at once. The blacksmith, routed out of his sleep,
excused himself, pleading the lateness of the hour and
the fact that there was no fire in his forge. The Devil
insisted, however, and promised liberal payment if the
work were done quickly. The blacksmith yielded at
length, but had not proceeded far in shaping the shoes
when the mare began to speak. “My cousin, don’t
you know me?” she said; “I am the tavern-keeper.”
Upon this the blacksmith was so horrified that neither
threats nor entreaties could prevail to make him proceed
with the shoeing, and before he had finished the
third shoe a cock crowed, and immediately the spell was
broken and the woman reassumed her own form. And
to point the moral of this legend, and as a warning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
to cheats, the two horse-shoes which the smith had
completed were nailed up in the village church at
Schwarzenstein.</p>

<p>5. According to an old tradition, the Lapp king,
Olaf Skötkonung (995-1030), wishing to become a
Christian, asked his royal contemporary, Ethelred II.
of England, to send him a teacher. In response to this
request Bishop Siegfried and three missionaries came
to Sweden, and, landing on the southwestern coast,
encamped the first night at Wexio, on Lake Sodre.
Here the bishop saw in a vision a great company of
angels, and thereupon determined to build a church
at that place. The pagan inhabitants, however, were
hostile to the undertaking, and seized the three missionaries,
Winaman, Unaman, and Sunaman, whom they
beheaded, and caused their heads to be thrown into
the water.</p>

<p>One night soon after this sad event Siegfried was
walking along the shore of the lake, sighing and praying,
when he espied three luminous objects approaching
on the water, borne onward by the waves, and soon he
recognized them as the heads of his friends. And,
behold, the first head said, “The dead shall be avenged.”
And a voice from the second head exclaimed, “When?”
Then replied the third head in solemn tones, “On their
children and children’s children.” This prophecy was
not, however, fulfilled to the letter, for through Siegfried’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
intercession Olaf consented to spare the lives
of the murderers, on condition that they should build
a Christian church in Wexio; and this church, which
still exists, has on its coat-of-arms, or seal, the representation
of three severed heads, in memory of the
occurrence and its legend. In this church hung formerly
a shoe of Wodan’s famous steed Sleipnir, as a
souvenir of the following tradition: When the church
bells rang for the first time to summon the people to
mass, Wodan came riding over the mountains, and,
when nearing Wexio, Sleipnir, in a sudden fright,
struck a rock with one of his feet, and the impress of
the powerful blow remains in the rock to this day.
But the shoe fell off and was placed in the church.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>6. Many years ago, so runs an old legend, a man
obtained employment at a farm in Norway, where, unknown
to him, the mistress was a witch. Although the
man had plenty of good wholesome food, he did not
thrive upon it, but became thinner each day. Being
troubled at this, he sought the counsel of a wise man,
from whom he learned the true character of his mistress.
He learned, moreover, that she had been in the
habit of transforming him into a horse at night while
he slept, and riding him to Troms Church, a fact which
fully accounted for his leanness.</p>

<p>The wise man also gave him a magical ointment, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
which to rub his head at bedtime, and by virtue of
which, on awaking the next morning, he found himself
standing by Troms Church with a bridle in his hand,
while behind him were a number of horses bound together
by their tails. Soon he perceived his mistress
coming out of the church, and when she was near
enough to him he threw the bridle over her head, and
instantly she was transformed into a handsome mare,
which he mounted and rode homeward. On his way,
however, he stopped at a farrier’s and had the animal
shod with four new shoes, and on reaching home he
told his master that he had bought a fine mare, that
would be an excellent mate for one which he already
had. His master bought the mare at a good price, but
when he took the bridle off she disappeared, and in her
place stood the mistress witch with new horse-shoes on
her hands and feet. Thereupon the man related the
wonderful tale of his experiences, and in consequence
thereof the wife was turned out of doors, and never
got rid of the horse-shoes.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>7. Once upon a time a gentleman of rank was driving
with four horses along the highway which runs
between the towns of Tübingen and Hirschau, in Würtemberg,
and when opposite a roadside chapel he scoffed
at a picture of the Madonna which adorned it. Immediately
his horses came to a standstill, nor could he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
make them proceed, in spite of vigorous urging. At
length, in this dilemma, a priest was called, who imposed
as a penance the removal of a shoe from the right
fore-foot of each horse, and after this had been done
the gentleman was enabled to continue his journey.
And in commemoration of this miracle one of the horse-shoes
was nailed upon the chapel-door, where it was
still to be seen in recent years.<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>8. One Sunday morning a swarthy rider on a black
horse rode at full speed through the village of Nabburg,
in Bavaria, directly to the blacksmith’s shop, to
have his horse shod. “Will you not rest on a Sunday?”
demanded the smith. “My steed and I journey
to and fro, and care nothing for the Christian
Sunday,” replied the horseman; “therefore shoe my
horse in the Devil’s name, and I counsel thee speak no
pious word meanwhile, for no devout person has yet
obtained the mastery over this spirited animal.” With
these words he sprang to the ground and stroked his
horse’s flowing mane. The smith, though ill at ease,
began the work, and the horse was as quiet as if under
a spell, much to the astonishment of his master, who
could scarce believe his eyes. Three shoes were quickly
set, and the smith called to his assistant, “Now, then,
in God’s name, hand me the last shoe!” Instantly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
fiery steed reared and struck out wildly, casting a shoe
with such force against the wall that it remains to this
day embedded there. But the horse and his rider were
seen no more.<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>9. In a wall on an estate called Ludwigstein, in
Schleswig-Holstein, is to be seen a large stone bearing
the imprint of a horse-shoe, wherewith is associated the
following tale: One morning many years ago a horseman
was riding along the road when the church prayer-bell
rang, whereupon he swore an oath and said, “May
the Devil take me if I am not again on this very spot
this evening when the bell again sounds.” And indeed
he kept his word, but at the stroke of the evening bell
his horse slipped upon the stone and broke a leg, and
the mark of a shoe is still to be seen there.</p>

<p>10. The Horse-Shoe imprint in the cemetery of the
Church of Our Lady at Munster. During the building
of this beautiful Gothic church in the fourteenth
century, the Devil observed its shapely proportions
with increasing displeasure, and bethought himself of
various schemes to hinder the work’s progress. Finally
he decided on trying to bewitch the architect’s senses.
Accordingly he braided his hair, arrayed himself in
gay female attire, bedecked with costly jewels, and
appeared before the architect, whom he sought to
ensnare with soft words and gifts. But the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
was not thus to be deceived. Leaning upon his measuring-rod,
he listened unmoved to the beguiling conversation
of the pretended belle, and rejected with
scorn the gold and precious stones which she brought
him. Thereupon the Devil became enraged, stamped
upon the ground with vehemence, and disappeared,
leaving behind him an evil smell; and the mark of
one of the iron horse-shoes, wherewith he was shod,
was deeply imprinted on a stone in the cemetery,
and, according to popular report, is still to be found
there.</p>

<p>The impressions on stone of figures of horse-shoes,
of which there are numerous examples in northern
Europe, are regarded by some archæologists as sacred
symbols of the pagans or relics of the cult of Wodan,
and as showing the sites of ancient altars and burial
places; while others maintain that these figures were
originally intended as boundary marks. Numerous
traditions associate them with battles fought in these
localities, and in the popular fancy they are imagined
to indicate the favorite haunts of witches, the meeting-places
where they held their revels, the horse-shoe mark
being an imprint of the Devil’s foot. These weird
rendezvous were usually on the tops of mountains or
hills, and are still known as Witches’ Dance-Places in
different parts of Europe, especially in Germany.</p>

<h3>XX. RECAPITULATION OF THEORIES OF THE ORIGIN
OF THE HORSE-SHOE SUPERSTITION</h3>

<p>In the preceding pages an attempt has been made to
furnish plausible reasons for the horse-shoe’s universal
popularity both as an amulet and as a token of good
luck. It is evident, however, that this superstition cannot
be referred to any one particular starting-point.
Just as the sources of a river may be manifold, consisting
of numerous springs and tributaries, so, too, the
belief in the horse-shoe’s magical virtues is of complex
origin, and can be traced to diverse beginnings.</p>

<p>It may be profitable, therefore, briefly to enumerate
the different theories which have been advanced:—</p>

<p>1. At the <em>rite of the Passover</em>, the blood sprinkled
upon the lintel and door-posts formed the chief points
of an arch. Hence the value of arch-shaped talismans.</p>

<p>2. The magical virtue of the horse-shoe against
witches and fiends has been attributed to its <em>bifurcated
form</em>, and to its resemblance to the <em>lunar crescent</em>.
Charms of similar shape are known to have been in use
among the ancient Chaldeans and Egyptians.</p>

<p>3. <em>Iron</em> and <em>steel</em>, metals having traditional power
against evil-disposed fairies and goblins.</p>

<p>4. The <em>serpentine shape</em>. Serpent-worship was
nearly universal among primitive peoples, and amuletic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
symbols of this form were in use in the days of ancient
Rome.</p>

<p>5. The so-called <em>horse-shoe arch</em> as typifying a beneficent,
protecting power.</p>

<p>6. The ancient conception of the earth as having
the shape of a <em>round boat turned upside down</em> and
corresponding to the Egyptian <em>Put-sign</em>.</p>

<p>7. <em>The Horse.</em> This animal was worshiped among
the early Germanic tribes, and an English myth accredits
to it luck-bringing qualities.</p>

<p>8. The Scandinavian superstition of the <em>Demon-Mare</em>.</p>

<p>9. The old astrological principle that <em>Mars</em>, the God
of War and the War Horse, was hostile to <em>Saturn</em>, the
liege-lord of witches.</p>

<p>10. The legend of <em>Saint Dunstan and the Devil</em>.</p>

<p>11. <em>Phallic Symbolism.</em></p>

<p>12. The <em>Aureole</em> or <em>Nimbus</em>.</p>

<p>13. Supernatural faculties ascribed to <em>blacksmiths</em>.</p>

<p>14. The Egyptian hieroglyphic symbol 𓎆, signifying
the <em>mystical door of life</em>.</p>

<p>15. <em>Horses’ hoof-prints</em> in mythology and tradition.</p>

<p>16. The horse-shoe a symbol of the heathen god
<em>Wodan</em>.</p>

<h3>XXI. CONCLUSION</h3>

<p>Whatever may be the origin of the superstitious employment
of the horse-shoe, its adoption as a token of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
good luck appears to be comparatively modern, its earliest
use having been for the exclusion of witches, evil
spirits, and all such uncanny beings.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject an extract may be given
from an article in the “London World,” August 23,
1753, against the repeal of the so-called Witch Act,
wherein the writer offers the following satirical advice
to whomever it might concern:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>To secure yourself against the enchantments of witches,
especially if you are a person of fashion and have never been
taught the Lord’s Prayer, the only method I know of is to
nail a horse-shoe upon the threshold. This I can affirm to be
of the greatest efficacy, insomuch that I have taken notice of
many a little cottage in the country with a horse-shoe at its
door where gaming, extravagance, Jacobitism, and all the
catalogue of witchcrafts have been totally unknown.</p>

</div>

<p>The world moves and civilization progresses, but the
old superstitions remain the same. The rusty horse-shoe
found on the road is still prized as a lucky token,
and will doubtless continue to be so prized; for human
nature does not change, and superstition is a part of
human nature.</p>

<h3>I. TYCHE, THE GRECIAN GODDESS OF GOOD LUCK</h3>

<p>Among the more popular divinities of the early
Grecians was Tyche, the goddess of good luck, whose
worship, according to Plutarch, complemented that of
Destiny. She ruled over accidental events, and was the
dispenser alike of blessings and misfortunes; but when
too lavish in the distribution of her favors she was liable
to incur the jealousy of Nemesis, the goddess of
retribution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Tyche, the Goddess of Fortune, is not mentioned in
the works of the earliest Grecian poets, but Homer and
Hesiod both allude to an ocean nymph of this name
who was gathering flowers with Proserpina when the
latter was carried off by Pluto.</p>

<p>The Theban lyric poet Pindar appears to have originated
the worship of Tyche, whom he celebrated in
verse, and invested with the title Pharopolis, or Protectress
of Cities;<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> and in Greece, towards the close of
the fifth century <span class="smcapuc">B. C.</span>, this goddess was generally believed
to be the ruler of worldly affairs. While Zeus
was, indeed, the most powerful of the gods, Tyche was
regarded by some as having the character of Providence;<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
yet she was more generally thought to be
identical with Chance or Luck. The famous Ionic
philosopher Anaxagoras said that Fortune was a cause
unknown to human reason; for some things come by
Necessity, some by fatal Destiny, and others by deliberate
Counsel.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<h3>II. THE ROMAN GODDESS FORTUNA</h3>

<p>The worship of the Goddess of Chance, <i lang="la">Fortuna</i>,
was introduced among the Romans from Greece during
the reign of Servius Tullius, and soon became very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
popular. Indeed, at one period Fortuna was the chief
Italian divinity, and the plebeians and slaves held an
annual festival on the twenty-fourth day of June in
honor of her who could bestow riches and liberty.
Pliny wrote that the Chance or Fortune by means of
which we acquire so much is a divine power; and Plutarch,
in his work on the Fortune of the Romans,
attempts to show that the great achievements of that
people were to be attributed to good luck rather than
to sagacity or prowess. As an example he cites their
escape from invasion by the opportune death of Alexander
the Great at Babylon, <span class="smcapuc">B. C.</span> 323, at a time when
he was preparing to overwhelm Italy with his armies.</p>

<p>The Roman biographer, Cornelius Nepos, in speaking
of the Greek general, Emenes the Cardian (<span class="smcapuc">B. C.</span> 361-317),
said that, even if the favors shown him by Fortune
had been commensurate with his great abilities, he would
not for that reason have been more eminent; for great
men should be measured by their qualities, and not
by their good or bad fortune. The Dutch <i lang="fr">savant</i>,
Desiderius Erasmus, wrote that Diogenes was wont
to rebuke with asperity those who blamed the goddess
when their affairs did not prosper; and he also
severely criticised the prevalent habit of craving at the
hands of Mistress Fortune, not such things as were
substantially good, but rather such as seemed to be so
in the fancy of the petitioners. Philip of Macedon, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the receipt of the news of great victories won by his
generals, thanked Fortune for her great goodness, modestly
beseeching of her only some “light and shrewd
turn again at another season.” And Erastus, commenting
on Philip’s moderation and good sense in not
being unduly elated by prosperity, quaintly remarked
that this great king, having profound wisdom and experience,
did not insolently leap and skip about on the
receipt of joyful tidings, but rather mistrusted the
pampering of Fortune, whom he knew to be a fickle
jade.</p>

<h3>III. THE CHARACTER OF FORTUNE</h3>

<p>Of all the pagan deities, Fortune was the most absolute
and the most universally worshiped; for she kept
all men at her feet, the prosperous through fear and
the unfortunate through hope.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> She was also an eccentric
goddess, not only favoring the brave, according
to the familiar maxim of Terence, but likewise being
decidedly partial to fools, if we may believe another
classical saying, <i lang="la">Fortuna favet fatuis</i>. And again, as
an ancient poet wrote, <i lang="la">Legem veretur nocens, Fortunam
innocens</i>. The satirist Juvenal said that, if men
were discreet, Fortune had no power over them. When
she entered Rome she folded her wings as a sign that
she wished to remain there; and, as has been aptly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
remarked, she is there still, for the modern Roman is
as firm a believer in luck, whether good or bad, as was
the Roman citizen two thousand years ago.<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> Among
the ancients, a lucky event, something opportune occurring
unexpectedly, was ascribed to a sudden caprice or
whim on the part of the goddess, while success in an
undertaking was thought to be due to her favor when
in a sober mood.<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>“Why was Fortune made a goddess?” asked St.
Augustine, since she is so blind that she runs to anybody
without distinction, and often passes by her admirers
to cling to those who despise her.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> And Cicero
remarked that Fortune was not only blind herself, but
often deprived her votaries of sight.</p>

<p>Pliny, in discoursing about the religious beliefs current
in his time, says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>All over the world, in all places and at all times, Fortune
is the only God whom every one invokes: she alone is spoken
of; she alone is accused and is supposed to be guilty; she
alone is in our thoughts, is praised and blamed, and is loaded
with reproaches; wavering as she is, conceived by the generality
of mankind to be blind, wandering, inconstant, uncertain,
variable, and often favoring the unworthy. To her are
referred all our losses and all our gains, and, in casting up the
accounts of mortals, she alone balances the two pages of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
sheet. We are so much in the power of chance, that chance
itself is considered as a God.</p>

</div>

<p>The representations of Fortune, which are to be seen
in ancient statues, bas-reliefs, medals, and coins, exhibit
the many different attributes of her character. The
earliest image of the goddess was probably at Smyrna,
and was the work of the eminent sculptor Bupalus, who
lived in the sixth century <span class="smcapuc">B. C.</span> She was here shown as
bearing on her head a hemisphere, and with the horn
of Amalthæa in her left hand, thus typifying the distribution
of all good things.<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>Her lack of discernment has been symbolized by
artists, who have portrayed her with a bandage before
her eyes; with a rudder, as guiding worldly affairs;
or with a wheel or ball, as types of instability. In a
painting by Sulzer, Fortune is shown seated on a
throne, which is borne aloft in the air by contrary
winds. In her hand is a magic wand, and her countenance
expresses inconstancy and fickleness, while in
her train follow Riches, Poverty, Despotism, and Slavery.
In the Villa d’Este, near the Italian town of
Tivoli, is a painting by Zucchari showing Fortune
astride of an ostrich, which has been supposed to be
an allegorical intimation that the goddess has a preference
for simpletons.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> In her temple at Thebes, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
held Wealth in her arms. Sometimes she was accompanied
by a winged youth named Favor, to denote how
speedily her favors may fly away from us;<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> or by a
winged Cupid, which has been thought to signify that,
in Love, Beauty has a less permanent influence than
Fortune.<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>Her numerous titles were usually complimentary, as
Golden or Royal Fortune, but she was disrespectfully
spoken of by Horace, Ovid, and other writers, by whom
she was characterized as unjust, fickle, and delighting
in mischief. One reproachful epithet applied to her
was <i lang="la">viscosa</i>, tenacious or sticky, because men are
caught in her toils like birds in quicklime.<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>The Abbé Banier, in his “Mythology and Fables of
the Ancients,” thus moralizes regarding Fortune, good
and bad:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>As men have always highly valued earthly goods, ’tis no
wonder that they adored Fortune. Fools! who thus instead
of acknowledging an intelligent Providence that distributes
riches and earthly goods, from views always wise, though
dark and placed beyond the reach of human discovery, addressed
their vows to an imaginary Being, that acted without
design and from the impulse of unavoidable necessity; for
’tis beyond question that, in the Pagan system, Fortune was
nothing else but Destiny. Accordingly she was confounded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
as we shall see afterwards, with the <i lang="la">Parcæ</i>, who were themselves
that fatal Necessity, which the poets have reasoned so
much about.</p>

</div>

<p>We learn from the historian Suetonius that the early
Roman emperors were wont to cherish small images
of Fortune, which they venerated as special tutelary
deities.</p>

<p>The goddess is said to have once appeared in a vision
to the Emperor Galba, who reigned <span class="smcapuc">A. D.</span> 68-69,
and to have informed him that she was standing weary
before his door, and that, if she were not quickly admitted,
every one dear to him would become her prey.
On awakening he found outside the entrance-hall of
his palace a bronze figure of Fortune, which he concealed
beneath his garments and carried to his summer
residence at Tusculum. There he set apart a sanctuary
for the image, and offered prayers to it each month,
keeping, moreover, in its honor an all-night vigil every
year. On one occasion Galba had intended to present
his little guardian genius with a necklace of pearls and
precious stones, but changed his mind and gave it to
the Capitoline Venus. The following night Fortune,
in angry mood, again appeared to the emperor in a
dream, complaining that she had been cheated out
of the intended gift, and threatening to take away
the many benefits which she had bestowed upon him.
Alarmed at this, Galba sent a messenger early in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
morning to prepare a sacrificial offering, and he himself
hastened to Tusculum, but found on the altar of the
sanctuary nothing but warm ashes; and near by stood
an old man clothed in black, holding in one hand a
glass plate containing incense, and in the other an
earthenware vessel full of sacrificial wine.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>Some verses containing uncomplimentary allusions to

<p>Among most civilized nations of the present day the
Goddess Fortune is not openly worshiped, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the Japanese have their seven Gods of Luck, which are
comparatively modern deities, brought together from
various sources, including their own primitive Shinto
religion, Buddhism, and the Taouism of China.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>The Lamas of Tibet perform each year a peculiar
scapegoat rite called the Chase of the Demon of Ill-luck.
One of their number, in fantastic garb and with
grotesquely painted face, sits in the market-place for a
week previously, and on the day of the ceremony this
worthy, who is known as a ghost-king, wanders about
shaking a black yak’s tail over the heads of the people,
whereby their ill-luck is in some mystic way transferred
to him.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<h3>IV. TEMPLES OF FORTUNE</h3>

<p>Temples in honor of the Goddess Tyche were built
at Elis, Corinth, and in other Grecian cities; and in
the second century <span class="smcapuc">A. D.</span> the eminent philanthropist,
Herodes Atticus, erected for her a temple in Athens,
the ruins of which are believed still to exist.<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>The western suburb of Syracuse, in Sicily, was called
Τύχη, after a temple of Tyche which adorned it.</p>

<p>Among the Italians the worship of Fortune became
so popular that her temples outnumbered all others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
“We have built a thousand temples to Fortune and
not one to Reason,” remarked Fronto, the worthy tutor
of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Of all these pagan
edifices in Rome, but a single one now remains, the
temple of Fortuna Virilis, now the church of Santa
Maria Egiziaca.<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> It is a small Ionic tetrastyle building
on the left bank of the Tiber, a little north of the
so-called Temple of the Sun. But the most famous
Italian temple of Fortune was at Preneste, an ancient
Latin town, now called Palestrina. Here oracles were
consulted and fugitives found a place of refuge.</p>

<p>In Great Britain there still exist a number of altars
in honor of Fortune, which date from the Roman occupation.
One of these, on the line of the wall of Antoninus
in Scotland, was erected by soldiers of the second
and sixth legions. Another altar, dedicated to the same
goddess, was found at the headquarters of the sixth
legion at Eboracum, the modern city of York, and is
still to be seen at the museum there.<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> The inscription
on this altar was copied by the writer during a recent
visit to York, and reads as follows:—</p>

<p class="center">DEÆ FORTUNÆ<br />
SOSIA<br />
IUNCINA<br />
Q. ANTONI<br />
ISAURICI<br />
LEG. AUG.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<h3>V. LUCK, ANCIENT AND MODERN</h3>

<p>Our English word <em>luck</em>, according to some authorities,
is of Scandinavian origin, while others consider it
to be the past tense of an Anglo-Saxon verb meaning
“to catch.” Luck signifies, therefore, <em>a good catch</em>,
and is analogous to the German <i lang="de">Glück</i>. It has been
aptly remarked that very many so-called strong-minded
persons, who would not for a moment admit that they
are superstitious, are yet not insensible to the fascination
of this little monosyllable. As Christian people,
we profess to believe implicitly in Divine Providence;
yet often because we cannot understand its workings,
we so far relapse into paganism as to worship secretly
the Goddess Fortune. The fact is, that superstition is
an ineradicable element of human nature. The combined
forces of religion, education, philosophy, and common
sense are allied in a perpetual warfare against it.
The thousand and one little credulities which form such
an important part of modern folk-lore may be intrinsically
the veriest whimsies and trifles, but they are
evidence of the tenacity of traditional beliefs.</p>

<p>The modern sailor carries in his pocket a bit of sealskin,
or an eagle’s beak, to shield him from the lightning;
and the Southern negro has his rabbit’s foot, and
a host of other outlandish fetiches, all for luck.</p>

<p>The millions of American negroes have, indeed, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
deeply-rooted love for the supernatural, and their character
exhibits a peculiar blending of superstition and
religion. Among the mixed colored races in Missouri,
for example, we find a bewildering jumble of African
Voodoo credulities, the traditions of the American
Indian, and religious fanaticism. Thus, in “Voodoo
Tales,” by Mary A. Owen, we read of an old crone
who kept her medicine-pipe and eagle-bone whistle
alongside of her books of devotion, carried a rosary
and rabbit’s foot in the same pocket, and wore a saint’s
toe dangling on her bosom, and a luck-ball under her
right arm.</p>

<p>It has been well said that only those whose minds
are predisposed to entertain idle fancies are wont to
regard misfortune as a natural sequence of the legion
of alleged evil omens. Yet we know that in all ages
and countries such notions have prevailed. The ancient
Chaldeans made use of magic formulæ to ward off ill-luck,
and Tacitus relates that the most trivial events
were regarded as portentous by the Roman people.
What a contrast to the credulity of a superstitious age
is afforded by the often quoted remark of Cato the
Censor, who refused to regard it as ominous when informed
that his boots had been gnawed by rats! “If
the boots had gnawed the rats,” he said, “it might have
portended evil.”</p>

<p>There is a deal of philosophy in the Irish saying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
“Every man has bad luck awaiting him some time or
other, but leave the bad luck to the last; perhaps it
may never come.”</p>

<p>In attributing the sundry and divers misfortunes of
our lives to bad luck, we surely ignore the fact that
these same unwelcome experiences are often the logical
sequences of our own shortcomings, and that the fickle
goddess cannot with fairness be made always to masquerade
as our scapegoat.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Jests, like salt, should be used sparingly.—<cite>Similitudes of Democritus.</cite></p>

<h3>I. ORIGIN AND HISTORY</h3>

<p>The origin of the use of common salt as a condiment
is hidden in the mazes of antiquity. Although we have
no evidence that this important article of diet was
known to the antediluvians, there is still abundant proof
that it was highly esteemed as a seasoner of food long
before the Christian era. In a Greek translation of a
curious fragment of the writings of the semi-fabulous
Phœnician author, Sanchoniathon, who is said to have
lived before the Trojan war, the discovery of the uses
of salt is attributed to certain immediate descendants of
Noah, one of whom was his son Shem.<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>From the mythical lore of Finland we learn that
Ukko, the mighty god of the sky, struck fire in the
heavens, a spark from which descending was received
by the waves and became salt. The Chinese worship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
an idol called Phelo, in honor of a mythological personage
of that name, whom they believe to have been the
discoverer of salt and the originator of its use. His
ungrateful countrymen, however, were tardy in their
recognition of Phelo’s merits, and that worthy thereupon
left his native land and did not return. Then the
Chinese declared him to be a deity, and in the month
of June each year they hold a festival in his honor,
during which he is everywhere eagerly sought, but in
vain; he will not appear until he comes to announce
the end of the world.</p>

<p>Among the Mexican Nahuas the women and girls
employed in the preparation of salt were wont to dance
at a yearly festival held in honor of the Goddess of
salt, Huixtocihuatl, whose brothers the rain-gods are
said, as the result of a quarrel, to have driven her into
the sea, where she invented the art of making the
precious substance.<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>The earliest Biblical mention of salt appears to be in
reference to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.
(Genesis xix. 24-26.) When King Abimelech destroyed
the city of Shechem, an event which is believed to have
occurred in the thirteenth century <span class="smcapuc">B. C.</span>, he is said to
have “sowed salt on it,” this phrase expressing the
completeness of its ruin.<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> (Judges ix. 45.) It is certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
that the use of salt as a relish was known to the
Jewish people at a comparatively early period of their
history. For in the sixth chapter of the Book of Job
occurs this passage: “Can that which is unsavoury be
eaten without salt?”</p>

<p>In Eastern countries it is a time-honored custom to
place salt before strangers as a token and pledge of
friendship and good-will. The phrase “to eat some
one’s salt” formerly signified being in that person’s
service, and in this sense it is used in the Book of Ezra,
iv. 14, where the expression, “we have maintenance
from the king’s palace,” means literally, “we are salted
with the salt of the palace,” which implies being in the
service of the king. And from the idea of being in the
employment of a master, and eating his salt, the phrase
in question came to denote faithfulness and loyalty.<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>As an instance of the superstitious reverence with
which salt is regarded in the East, it is related that
Yacoub ben Laith, who founded the dynasty of Persian
princes known as the Saffarides, was of very humble
origin, and in his youth gained a livelihood as a free-booter.
Yet so chivalrous was he that he never stripped
his victims of all their belongings, but always left them
something to begin life with anew.</p>

<p>On one occasion this gallant robber had forcibly and
by stealth entered the palace of a prince, and was about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
departing with considerable spoil, when he stumbled over
an object which his sense of taste revealed to be a lump
of salt. Having thus involuntarily partaken of a pledge
of hospitality in another man’s house, his honor overcame
his greed of gain and he departed without his
booty.<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>Owing to its antiseptic and preservative qualities, salt
was emblematic of durability and permanence; hence
the expression “Covenant of Salt.” It was also a symbol
of wisdom, and in this sense was doubtless used by
St. Paul when he told the Colossians that their speech
should be seasoned with salt.</p>

<p>Homer called salt divine, and Plato described it as a
substance dear to the gods.</p>

<p>Perhaps the belief in its divine attributes may have
been a reason for the employment of salt as a sacrificial
offering by the Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans, all of
whom, moreover, regarded it as an indispensable relish.</p>

<p>Plutarch said that without salt nothing was savory or
toothsome, and that this substance even imparted an
additional flavor to wines, thus causing them “to go
down the throat merrily.” And the same writer remarked
that, as bread and salt were commonly eaten
together, therefore Ceres and Neptune were sometimes
worshiped together in the same temple.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<h3>II. SALT UNCONGENIAL TO WITCHES AND DEVILS</h3>

<p>Grimm remarks that salt is not found in witches’
kitchens, nor at devils’ feasts, because the Roman Catholic
Church has taken upon herself the hallowing and
dedication of this substance. Moreover, inasmuch as
Christians recognize salt as a wholesome and essential
article of diet, it seems plausible enough that they
should regard it as unsuitable for the use of devils and
witches, two classes of beings with whom they have no
particular sympathy. Hence perhaps the familiar saying
that “the Devil loveth no salt in his meat.”</p>

<p>Once upon a time, according to tradition, there lived
a German peasant whose wife was a witch, and the
Devil invited them both to supper one fine evening.
All the dishes lacked seasoning, and the peasant, in
spite of his wife’s remonstrances, kept asking for salt;
and when after a while it was brought, he remarked
with fervor, “Thank God, here is salt at last,” whereupon
the whole scene vanished.<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>The abbot Richalmus, who lived in the old German
duchy of Franconia in the twelfth century, claimed, by
the exercise of a special and extraordinary faculty, to
be able to baffle the machinations of certain evil spirits
who took special delight in playing impish tricks upon
churchmen. They appear, indeed, to have sorely tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the patience of the good abbot in many ways, as, for
example, by distracting his thoughts during Mass and
interfering with his digestion, promoting discords in the
church music, and causing annoyance by inciting the
congregation to cough in sermon time. Fortunately he
possessed three efficient weapons against these troublesome
creatures, namely, the sign of the cross, holy
water, and salt.</p>

<p>“Evil spirits,” wrote the abbot, “cannot bear salt.”
When he was at dinner, and the Devil had maliciously
taken away his appetite, he simply tasted a little salt,
and at once became hungry. Then, if soon afterwards
his appetite again failed him, he took some more salt,
and his relish for food speedily returned.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>In Hungarian folk-lore, contrary to the usual opinion,
evil personages are fond of salt, for at those festive
gatherings described in old legends and fairy tales,
where witches and the Devil met, they were wont to
cook in large kettles a stew of horse-flesh seasoned with
salt, upon which they eagerly feasted.</p>

<p>Hence appears to have originated the popular notion
current among the Magyars that a woman who experiences
a craving for salt in the early morning must be
a witch, and on no account should her taste be gratified.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, says tradition, a man crept into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
witch’s tub in order to spy upon the proceedings at a
meeting of the uncanny sisterhood.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter the witch appeared, saddled the tub,
and rode it to the place of rendezvous, and on arriving
there the man contrived to empty a quantity of salt into
the tub. After the revels he was conveyed homewards
in the same manner, and showed the salt to his neighbors
as proof positive that he had really been present
at the meeting. Sometimes, however, salt is used in
Hungary as a protection against witches. The threshold
of a new house is sprinkled with it, and the door-hinges
are smeared with garlic, so that no witch may
enter.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>The peasants of Russian Esthonia are aware of the
potency of salt against witches and their craft. They
believe that on St. John’s Eve witch-butter is maliciously
smeared on the doors of their farm-buildings
in order to spread sickness among the cattle. When,
therefore, an Esthonian farmer finds this obnoxious
butter on his barn-door or elsewhere, he loads his gun
with salt and shoots the witch-germs away.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>The Hindus have a theory that malignant spirits, or
<i>Bhúts</i>, are especially prone to molest women and children
immediately after the latter have eaten confectionery
and other sweet delicacies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed, so general is this belief that vendors of
sweetmeats among school-children provide their youthful
customers each with a pinch of salt to remove the
sweet taste from their mouths, and thus afford a safeguard
against the ever-watchful <i>Bhúts</i>.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<h3>III. THE LATIN WORD “SAL”</h3>

<p>Owing to the importance of salt as a relish, its Latin
name <i lang="la">sal</i> came to be used metaphorically as signifying
a savory mental morsel, and, in a general sense, wit or
sarcasm.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> It was formerly maintained by some etymologists
that this word had a threefold meaning according
to its gender. Thus, when masculine, it has the
above signification, but when feminine it means <em>the sea</em>,
and only when neuter does it stand for common salt.
The characterization of Greece as “the salt of nations”
is attributed to Livy, and this is probably the origin
of the phrase “Attic salt,” meaning delicate, refined
wit. The phrase <i lang="la">cum grano salis</i> may signify the
grain of common sense with which one should receive
a seemingly exaggerated report. It may also mean
moderation, even as salt is used sparingly as a seasoner
of food.</p>

<p>Among the ancients, as with ourselves, <i lang="la">Sol</i> and <i lang="la">sal</i>,
the Sun and salt, were known to be two things essential
to the maintenance of life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Soldiers, officials, and working people were paid either
wholly or in part in salt,<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> which was in such general use
for this purpose that any sum of money paid for labor
or service of whatever kind was termed a <i lang="la">salarium</i>, or
salary, that is, the wherewithal to obtain one’s salt.<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>Pliny remarked that salt was essential for the complete
enjoyment of life, and in confirmation of this
statement he commented on the fact that the word
<i lang="la">sales</i> was employed to express the pleasures of the
mind, or a keen appreciation of witty effusions, and,
therefore, was associated with the idea of good fellowship
and mirth.<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>A certain mystic significance has been attributed to
the three letters composing the word “sal.” Thus, the
letter S, standing alone, represents or suggests two circles
united together, the sun and the moon. It typifies,
moreover, the union of things divine and mundane,
even as salt partakes of the attributes of each. A,
alpha, signifies the beginning of all things; while L is
emblematic of something celestial and glorious. S and
L represent solar and lunar influences respectively, and
the trio of letters stand for an essential substance provided
by God for the benefit of his people. In a curious
treatise on salt, originally published in 1770, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
writer launches forth in impassioned style the most
extravagant encomiums upon this substance, which he
avers to be the quintessence of the earth. Salt is here
characterized as a Treasure of Nature, an Essence of
Perfection, and the Paragon of Preservatives. Moreover,
whoever possesses salt thereby secures a prime
factor of human happiness among material things.<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>The French people employ the word “salt” metaphorically
in several common expressions. Thus, in speaking
of the lack of piquancy or pointedness in a dull
sermon or address, they say, “There was no salt in that
discourse.” And of the brilliant productions of a
favorite author they remark, “He has sprinkled his
writings with salt by handfuls.”<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> In like manner
they use the term <i lang="fr">un epigramme salé</i> to denote a cutting
sarcasm or raillery. Very apt also is the following
definition by an old English writer:<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> “Salt, a pleasaunt
and merrie word that maketh folks to laugh and sometime
pricketh.” The expression “to salt an invoice”
signifies to increase the full market value of each article,
and corresponds to one use of the French verb
<i lang="fr">saler</i>, to overcharge, and hence to “fleece” or “pluck.”
Thus the phrase <i lang="fr">Il me l’a bien salé</i> means “He has
charged me an excessive price.”<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<h3>IV. SALT EMPLOYED TO CONFIRM AN OATH</h3>

<p>In the records of the Presbytery of Edinburgh, under
date of September 20, 1586, is to be found the following
description of an oath which Scotch merchants
were required to take when on their way to the
Baltic:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Certan merchantis passing to Danskerne (Denmark) and
cuming neir Elsinnure, chusing out and quhen they accompted
for the payment of the toill of the goods, and that depositioun
of ane othe in forme following, viz: Thei present and offer
<em>breid</em> and <em>salt</em> to the deponer of the othe, whereon he layis
his hand and deponis his conscience and sweiris.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Gypsies likewise sometimes use bread and salt to confirm
the solemnity of an oath. An example of this is
recorded in the “Pesther Lloyd” of July 1, 1881. A
member of a gypsy band in western Hungary had been
robbed of a sum of money, and so informed his chief,
who summoned the elders of the camp to a council.
On an upright cross formed of two poles was placed a
piece of bread sprinkled with salt, and upon this each
gypsy was required to swear that he was not the thief.
The real culprit, refusing to take so solemn an oath,
was thus discovered.</p>

<p>Among the Jews the covenant of salt is the most
sacred possible. Even at the present time, Arabian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
princes are wont to signify their ratification of an alliance
by sprinkling salt upon bread, meanwhile exclaiming,
“I am the friend of thy friends, and the enemy of
thine enemies.” So likewise there is a common form
of request among the Arabs as follows: “For the sake
of the bread and salt which are between us, do this or
that.”<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>In the East, at the present day, compacts between
tribes are still confirmed by salt, and the most solemn
pledges are ratified by this substance. During the
Indian mutiny of 1857 a chief motive of self-restraint
among the Sepoys was the fact that they had sworn by
their salt to be loyal to the English queen.<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>The antiquity of the practice of using salt in confirmation
of an oath is shown in the following passage
from an ode of the Greek lyric poet Archilochus, who
flourished during the early part of the seventh century
<span class="smcapuc">B. C.</span>:—</p>

<p>In the year 1731 the Protestant miners and peasants
inhabiting the “salt exchequer lands,” prior to their
banishment from the country by Leopold, Archbishop
of Salzburg, held a meeting in the picturesque village
of Schwarzach, and “solemnly ratified their league by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
the ancient custom of dipping their fingers in salt.”
The table at which this ceremony took place, and a
picture representing the event, are still shown at the
Wallner Inn, where the meeting was held.<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<h3>V. SALT-SPILLING AS AN OMEN</h3>

<p>The widespread notion that the spilling of salt produces
evil consequences is supposed to have originated
in the tradition that Judas overturned a salt-cellar at
the Paschal Supper, as portrayed in Leonardo da Vinci’s
painting. But it appears more probable that the belief
is due to the sacred character of salt in early times.
Any one having the misfortune to spill salt was formerly
supposed to incur the anger of all good spirits, and to
be rendered susceptible to the malevolent influences of
demons.<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> When, in oriental lands, salt was offered to
guests as a token of hospitality, it was accounted a
misfortune if any particles were scattered while being
so presented, and in such cases a quarrel or dispute was
anticipated.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<p>Bishop Hall wrote, in 1627, that when salt fell
towards a superstitious guest at dinner, he was wont
to exhibit signs of mental agitation, and refused to be
comforted until one of the waiters had poured wine in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
his lap. And in Gayton’s “Art of Longevity” we
find these lines:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I have two friends of either sex, which do eat little salt or
none, yet are friends too; of both which persons I can truly
tell, they are of patience most invincible; whom out of temper
no mischance at all can put; no, if towards them the salt
should fall.</p>

</div>

<p>The Germans have a saying, “Whoever spills salt
arouses enmity,” and in some places the overthrow of a
salt-cellar is thought to be the direct act of the Devil,
the peace-disturber. The superstitious Parisian, who
may have been the unfortunate cause of such a mishap,
is quite ready to adopt this view, and tosses a little of
the spilled salt behind him, in order, if possible, to hit
the invisible Devil in the eye, which, temporarily at
least, prevents him from doing further mischief.<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> This
is probably a relic of an ancient idolatrous custom; and
salt thus thrown was formerly a kind of sop to Cerberus,
an offering to pacify some particular deity. In
like manner the natives of Pegu, a province of British
Burmah, in the performance of one of their rites in
honor of the Devil, are wont to throw food over their
left shoulders to conciliate the chief spirit of evil.<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>When salt was spilled at table the pious Roman was
wont to exclaim, “May the gods avert the omen!” and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the modern Sicilian, in such a case, invokes “the Mother
of Light.”</p>

<p>Among the Greeks it was customary to present salt
to the gods as a thank-offering at the beginning of
every meal. Louis Figuier, in “Les merveilles de
l’industrie,” places these three happenings in the category
of ominous mishaps in a Grecian household: (1)
the omission of a salt-cellar from among the furnishings
of a dinner-table; (2) the falling asleep of one of the
guests at a banquet, before the removal of the salt-cellar
to make place for the dessert; (3) the overturning of
this important vessel. It seems evident, therefore, that
the origin of the belief in the ominous character of
salt-spilling is of far greater antiquity than is popularly
supposed; and Leonardo da Vinci, in portraying Judas
as upsetting a salt-cellar, probably had in mind the
already well-known portentous significance of such an
act. But some observers have failed to discover any
trace of a salt-cellar in the original <i lang="it">Cenacolo</i> on the
refectory wall of the Milanese convent. In the well-known
engraving by Raphael Morghen, however, the
overthrown salt-cellar is clearly delineated, and the
spilled salt is seen issuing from it. An animated discussion
on this moot-point enlivened the columns of
“Notes and Queries” some years ago.</p>

<p>The following passage is to be found in a work entitled
“Hieroglyphica, a Joanne Valeriano” (1586),
being a treatise on ancient symbols:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Alioqui sal amicitiæ symbolum fuit, durationis gratia. Corpora
enim solidiora facit et diutissime conservat. Unde hospitibus
ante alios cibos apponi solitum, quo amicitiæ firmitas
ac perseverantia significetur. Quare plerique ominosum
habent si sal in mensam profundi contigerit. Contra vero
faustum si vinum atque id merum effusum sit.</p>

</div>

<p>Which has been rendered into English as follows:
“Salt was formerly a symbol of friendship, because of
its lasting quality. For it makes substances more compact
and preserves them for a long time: hence it was
usually presented to guests before other food, to signify
the abiding strength of friendship. Wherefore many
consider it ominous to spill salt on the table, and, on
the other hand, propitious to spill wine, especially if
unmixed with water.”<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>In Gaule’s “Magastromancer” (1652), overturning
the salt is mentioned in a list of “superstitious ominations.”
According to a popular Norwegian belief, one
will shed as many tears as may suffice to dissolve the
quantity of salt which he has spilled;<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> and in east
Yorkshire, also, every grain of spilled salt represents a
tear to be shed. Moreover, saltness has been thought
to be an essential attribute of tears, and this intimate
connection between the two may have given rise to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
some of the many superstitions connected with salt.<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>
In Bucks County, Pennsylvania, in order to avert ill-luck
after salt has been spilled, one should not only toss
a pinch of the spilled salt over the left shoulder, but
should also crawl under a table and come out on the
opposite side.<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>In the “British Apollo” (1708) are these lines:—</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In New England the gravity of salt-spilling as an
omen, its deplorable severance of friendship’s ties, and
the necessity for prompt remedial measures, are all fully
recognized.</p>

<p>And here the deft toss of the spilled particles over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the left shoulder is not always adequate; for in order
thoroughly to break the spell, these particles must be
thrown on the stove.<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>Gypsies have a saying, “The salt of strife has
fallen.”</p>

<p>From the idea of the desecration of a sacred substance,
to which allusion has been made, doubtless arose
the remarkable superstition that, as a penalty for spilling
salt, one must wait outside the gate of Paradise for
as many years as there are grains of salt spilled.<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>In the Lansdowne MSS. 231 (British Museum) occurs
this passage:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The falling of salt is an authentic ꝑsag̅emt of ill-luck, nor
can every temper contemn it; nor was the same a grall
ꝑgnostic among the ancients of future evil, but a ꝑticular
omination concerning the breach of friendship. For salt as
incorruptible was yᵉ symbole of friendship, and before ye other
service was offered unto yᵉⁱʳ guests. But whether salt were
not only a symbol of friendship wʰ man, but also a fig. of
amity and reco̅ciliation wʰ God, and was therefore offered in
sacrifices, is an higher speculation.</p>

</div>

<p>Herbert Spencer affirms<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> that the consciousness which
harbors a notion that evil will result from spilling salt
is manifestly allied to the consciousness of the savage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and is prone to entertain other superstitious beliefs like
those prevalent in barbarous lands. And although
idolatry and fetich-worship do not flourish in civilized
communities, yet many popular superstitions are akin
in nature to the sentiments which prompt the savage to
bow down before images of wood or stone.</p>

<h3>VI. HELPING TO SALT AT TABLE</h3>

<p>In the northern counties of England, and indeed
quite generally in Anglican communities, it is reckoned
unlucky to be helped to salt at table, and this idea has
found expression in the popular couplet, “Help me to
salt, help me to sorrow.” In a small volume entitled
“The Rules of Civility” (London, 1695), translated
from the French, and quoted in “Brand’s Popular
Antiquities,” is the following passage:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Some are so exact they think it uncivil to help anybody
that sits by them either with <em>salt</em> or <em>brains</em>. But in my judgment
that is a ridiculous scruple, and if your neighbor desires
you to furnish him (with salt), you must either take out some
with your knife and lay it upon his plate, or if they be more
than one, present them with the salt that they may furnish
themselves.</p>

</div>

<p>In Russia there is a superstitious prejudice against
helping one’s neighbor to salt at table on account of the
liability to quarrels thereby incurred. For in so doing
one is thought to have the air of implying, “Well, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
have received your allowance of salt, now go away.”
But if in proffering the salt one smiles amicably, all
danger of a quarrel is happily averted, and the act is
wholly relieved of its ominous character.<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>The simple expedient of a second help is commonly
regarded as equally effective for this purpose, but it is
difficult to imagine whence was derived the alleged
potency of such an antidote, which is contrary to the
Pythagorean theory of the divine character of unity and
the diabolical attributes of the number two.</p>

<p>In many lands, however, it is only common courtesy
to help a friend to salt at table; but in Italy this delicate
attention was formerly thought to be a mark of
undue familiarity, and, when salt was offered by one
gentleman to the wife of another, it was a sufficient
cause for jealousy and even quarrel.<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<h3>VII. SALT AS A PROTECTION TO YOUNG INFANTS</h3>

<p>The mediæval Roman Catholic custom of using salt
to protect infants from evil prior to their baptism is
frequently alluded to in early romantic literature. In
an ancient ballad entitled “The King’s Daughter,” the
birth of a child occurs under circumstances which prevent
the administration of the rite of baptism. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
mother, therefore, exposes the baby in a casket, and is
careful to place by its side salt and candles. The words
of the ballad are:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The bairnie she swyl’d in linen so fine,</div>
<div class="verse">In a gilded casket she laid it syne,</div>
<div class="verse">Mickle saut and light she laid therein,</div>
<div class="verse">Cause yet in God’s house it had’na been.<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. William G. Black, in his work on Folk-Medicine,
says that in some districts of Scotland it was formerly
a custom, previous to baptism, to carry some salt
around the child “withershins,” or backwards,—a procedure
which was believed to protect the child from evil
during its oftentimes long journey from the house to
the church where the ceremony was to be performed.
In Marsala the relatives of a new-born child do not
sleep the first night, for fear of the appearance of
witches. Indeed, a watch is often kept for many nights,
or until the child’s baptism. A light burns in the room
constantly, and an image of some saint is fastened upon
the house-door. A rosary and a raveled napkin are
attached to the image, and behind the door are placed
a jug of salt and a broom. When a witch comes and
sees the saint’s image and the rosary, she usually goes
away at once; but even if these talismans are wanting,
the salt, napkin, and broom afford adequate protection.
For any witch before entering must count the grains of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
salt, the threads of the napkin’s fringe, and the twigs
of which the broom is made. And she never has time
enough for these tasks, because she cannot appear before
midnight, and must hide herself before the dawn.<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>This popular belief in the magical power of salt
to protect infants from evil, especially in the period
between birth and baptism, is exemplified in the following
allusion to a foundling in a metrical “History of
the Family of Stanley,” which dates from the early part
of the sixteenth century (Harleian MSS. 541, British
Museum): “It was uncrisned, seeming out of doubt,
for salt was bound at its neck in a linen clout.”<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<p>In Sicily, too, it is sometimes customary for the priest
to place a little salt in the child’s mouth at baptism,
thereby imparting wisdom. Hence the popular local
saying in regard to a person who is dull of understanding,
that the priest put but little salt in his mouth.<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> A
similar usage is in vogue in the district of Campine in
Belgium. The use of salt at baptism in the Christian
Church dates from the fourth century. It was an early
practice to place salt, which had been previously blessed,
in the infant’s mouth, to symbolize the counteraction
of the sinfulness of its nature.<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>So, too, in the baptismal ceremonies of the Church of
England in mediæval times, salt, over which an exorcism
had been said, was placed in the child’s mouth, and its
ears and nostrils were touched with saliva,—practices
which became obsolete at about the time of the reign of
Henry VIII.</p>

<p>An octagonal font of the fifteenth century, in St.
Margaret’s Church, Ipswich, Suffolk, has upon one of
its sides the figure of an angel bearing a scroll, on
which appears a partially illegible inscription containing
the words <i lang="la">Sal et Saliva</i>.<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>Thomas Ady, in “A Perfect Discovery of Witches”
(London, 1661), says that holy water, properly conjured,
was used to keep the Devil in awe, and to prevent his
entering churches or dwellings.</p>

<p>With such holy water Satanic influences were kept
away from meat and drink, and from “the very salt
upon the table.”</p>

<p>In the Highlands of Scotland, instead of using salt
as an amulet for the protection of young babies, it was
customary for watchers to remain constantly by the
cradle until the christening. For it was believed that
spiteful fairies were wont to carry off healthy infants,
leaving in their stead puny specimens of their own elfish
offspring; and infants thus kidnapped were sometimes
kept in fairyland for seven years. This well-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
popular belief gave rise to the word “changeling,”
which signifies a “strange, stupid, ugly child left by
the fairies in place of a beautiful or charming child
that they have stolen away.”<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> And inasmuch as baby
elves were invariably stunted and of feeble intellect,
all idiotic and dwarfish children were thought to be
changelings.<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<h3>VIII. SALT AS A MAGICAL SUBSTANCE</h3>

<p>The natives of Morocco regard salt as a talisman
against evil, and a common amulet among the Neapolitan
poor is a bit of rock-salt suspended from the neck.<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>
The peasants of the Hartz Mountain region in Germany
believe that three grains of salt in a milk-pot will keep
witches away from the milk;<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> and to preserve butter
from their uncanny influences, it was a custom in the
county of Aberdeen, Scotland, some years ago, to put
salt on the lid of a churn.<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> In Normandy, also, the
peasants are wont to throw a little salt into a vessel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
containing milk, in order to protect the cow who gave
the milk from the influences of witchcraft.</p>

<p>Peculiar notions about the magical properties of salt
are common among American negroes. Thus in some
regions a new tenant will not move into a furnished
house until all objects therein have been thoroughly
salted, with a view to the destruction of witch-germs.<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
Another example of the supernatural attributes ascribed
to salt is the opinion current among uneducated people
in some communities of its potency in casting a spell
over obnoxious individuals. For this purpose it is sufficient
either to sprinkle salt over the sleeping form
of an enemy, or on the grave of one of his ancestors.<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
Another kind of salt-spell in vogue in the south of
England consists in throwing a little salt into the fire
on three successive Friday nights, while saying these
words:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">It is not this salt I wish to burn,</div>
<div class="verse">It is my lover’s heart to turn;</div>
<div class="verse">That he may neither rest nor happy be,</div>
<div class="verse">Until he comes and speaks to me.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On the third Friday night the disconsolate damsel expects
her lover to appear.<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> Every one is familiar with
the old saying, “You can catch a bird with your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
hand, if you first put some salt on its tail.” This quaint
expression has been thought to imply that, if one can
get near enough to a bird to place salt on its tail, its
capture is an easy matter. The phrase, however, may
be more properly attributed to a belief in the magical
properties of salt in casting a spell over the bird.
Otherwise any substance might be equally effective for
the purpose of catching it. The writer remembers having
read somewhere an old legend about a young man
who playfully threw some salt on the back of a witch
sitting next to him at table, and the witch thereupon
acquired such an increase of avoirdupois that she was
unable to move until the young man obligingly brushed
away the salt.</p>

<p>The ancient Teutons believed that the swift flight of
birds was caused by certain powerful spirits of the air.
Now salt is a foe to ghostly might, imparts weight to
bodies, and impedes their motion; therefore the rationale
of its operation when placed upon a bird’s tail is
easily intelligible.</p>

<p>In the Province of Quebec French Canadians sometimes
scatter salt about the doors of their stables to prevent
those mischievous little imps called <i>lutins</i> from
entering and teasing the horses by sticking burrs in
their manes and tails.<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> The <i>lutin</i> or <i>gobelin</i> is akin to
the Scandinavian household spirit, who is fond of children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
and horses, and who whips and pinches the former
when they are naughty, but caresses them when good.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
In Marsala, west Sicily, a horse, mule, or donkey, on
entering a new stall, is thought to be liable to molestation
by fairies. As a precautionary measure, therefore,
a little salt is placed on the animal’s back, and this is
believed to insure freedom from lameness, or other evil
resulting from fairy spite.<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> Common salt has long
enjoyed a reputation as a means of procuring disenchantment.
It was an ingredient of a salve “against
nocturnal goblin visitors” used by the Saxons in England,
and described in one of their ancient leech-books;<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>
while in the annals of folk-medicine are to be found
numerous references to its reputed virtues as a magical
therapeutic agent. In Scotland, when a person is ailing
of some affection whose nature is not apparent, as much
salt as can be placed on a sixpence is dissolved in
water, and the solution is then applied three times to the
soles of the patient’s feet, to the palms of his hands,
and to his forehead. He is then expected to taste the
mixture, a portion of which is thrown over the fire while
saying, “Lord, preserve us frae a’ skaith.”<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>The Germans of Buffalo valley in central Pennsylvania
believe that a boy may be cured of homesickness
by placing salt in the hems of his trousers and making
him look up the chimney.<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p>In India the natives rub salt and wine on the affected
part of the body as a cure for scorpion bites, believing
that the success of this treatment is due to the supernatural
virtue of the salt in scaring away the fiends who
caused the pain.<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> An ancient Irish charm of great
repute in cases of suspected “fairy-stroke” consisted in
placing on a table three equal portions of salt in three
parallel rows. The would-be magician then encircles
the salt with his arm and repeats the Lord’s Prayer
thrice over each row. Then, taking the hand of the
fairy-struck person, he says over it, “By the power of
the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, let
this disease depart and the spell of evil spirits be
broken.” Then follows a solemn adjuration and command
addressed to the supposed demon, and the charm

<p>In Bavaria and the Ukraine, in order to ascertain
whether a child has been the victim of bewitchment, the
mother licks its forehead; and if her sense of taste

<p>In the Swiss canton of Bern a person is believed to
be amply fortified against all kinds of spiritual enemies
by the simple expedient of carrying a piece of fresh
bread and a psalm-book in the right and left coat pockets
respectively, provided one is careful to have some
rock-salt either in each vest pocket, or inside a briar-wood
cane upon which three crosses have been cut.<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>
In Bohemia a mother seeks to protect her daughter
from evil glances by placing a little bread and salt in
her pocket; and when a young girl goes out for a walk
the mother sprinkles salt on the ground behind her, so
that she may not lose her way.<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p>Holy water has been employed in the religious ceremonies
of many peoples as a means of purifying both
persons and things, and also to keep away demons.
Sprinkling and washing with it were important features
of the Greek ritual.</p>

<p>The holy water of the Roman Catholic Church is
prepared by exorcising and blessing salt and water
separately, after which the salt is dissolved in the water
and a benediction pronounced upon the mixture. In
the Hawaiian ritual, sea-water was sometimes preferred.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>A Magyar house-mistress will not give any salt to a
woman who may come to the door and ask for it in the
early morning, believing that any such would-be borrower
is surely a witch; but in order to keep away all
witches and hags, she strews salt on the threshold. On
St. Lucien’s Day neither salt nor fire must be taken out
of the house.<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p>Among the Japanese, the mysterious preservative
qualities of salt are the source of various superstitions.
The mistress of a household will not buy it at night,
and when purchased in the daytime a small quantity is
thrown into the fire in order to prevent discord in the
family, and to avert misfortune generally.<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>In Scotland salt was formerly in high repute as a
charm, and the salt-box was the first chattel to be
removed to a new dwelling. When Robert Burns, in
the year 1789, was about to occupy a new house at
Ellisland, he was escorted on his route thither along
the banks of the river Nith by a procession of relatives,
and in their midst was borne a bowl of salt resting on
the family Bible.<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p>In some places in the north of England the giving
away of salt is a dangerous procedure; for if the salt
thus given comes into the possession of an evil-wisher,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
it places the donor entirely in the power of such a
person.<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>In upper Egypt, previous to the setting out of a
caravan, it is customary for the native women to throw
salt on burning coals, which are carried in earthen vessels
and set down before the different loads. While
so doing they exclaim, “May you be blessed in going
and coming,” and such incantations they believe render
inert all the machinations of evil spirits.<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<h3>IX. MISCELLANEOUS REMARKS ON SALT</h3>

<p>Among the peasants of the Spanish province of Andalusia
the word “salt” is synonymous with gracefulness
and charm of manner, and no more endearing or flattering
language can be used in addressing a woman, whether
wife or sweetheart, than to call her “the salt-box of my
love.” The phrase “May you be well salted” is also
current as an expression of affectionate regard.<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>Scotch fishermen have a traditional custom of salting
their nets “for luck,” and they also sometimes throw a
little salt into the sea “to blind the fairies.”</p>

<p>In the Isle of Man the interchange of salt is regarded
as indispensable to every business transaction, while
Manx beggars have even been known to refuse an alms
if proffered without it.<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>In Syracuse, Sicily, salt has won distinction as a symbol
of wisdom through a curious misinterpretation of
the words <i lang="la">sedes sapientiæ</i> of the so-called Lauretane
litany; these words becoming in the mouths of the
people <i lang="it">sale e sapienza</i>,<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> salt and wisdom.</p>

<p>Salt and bread, representing the necessaries of life,
are the first articles taken into the dwelling of a newly
married pair in Russia. And in Pomerania, at the
close of a wedding breakfast, a servant carries about
a plate containing salt, upon which the guests place
presents of money.<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p>In olden times bread and salt were reckoned the
simplest and most indispensable articles of diet, and
were offered to guests as a guarantee of hospitality
and friendliness. The universal reputation of salt as
a symbol of good-will is shown in the proverbs and
current sayings of many nations. Cicero, in his treatise
on Friendship, wrote that age increased the value of
friendships, even as it improved the quality of certain
wines; and he added further that there was truth in the
proverb, “Many pecks of salt must be eaten together
to bring friendship to perfection.”</p>

<p>Inasmuch as salt is a necessary and wholesome article
of diet, a generous use of it is reckoned beneficial.
Evan Marlett Boddy, F. R. C. S., in his “History of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Salt,” p. 78, comments with some asperity on the custom,
prevalent at the tables of English gentlefolk, of
placing salt in the tiniest receptacles, as if it were a
most expensive substance. He regards it as anything
but edifying “to see the host and his guests, in the
most finical, grotesque manner, help themselves to the
almost infinitesimal quantities of salt, as if it were a
mark of good breeding and delicacy.” On the contrary,
he continues, such stupid customs of “good society”
are truly indicative of mental weakness and
profound ignorance.</p>

<p>In a treatise on the “Dignity and Utility of Salt,”
by Jean de Marcounille Percheron, Paris, 1584, this
mineral is likened in value to the four elements recognized
by the ancients,—earth, air, fire, and water; and
indeed, on account of its importance for the maintenance
of health in the animal economy, salt has been termed
a “fifth element.” So highly did the Thracians of old
prize this commodity that they bartered slaves in exchange
for it, whence originated the phrase <i lang="la">Sale emptum
mancipium</i>.</p>

<p>The Egyptian geographer, Cosmas, stated that a salt
currency was in use in Africa in the sixth century;<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>
and Marco Polo wrote that salt was a common medium
of exchange among certain Asiatic peoples in the thirteenth
century. In Tibet, for example, pieces of salt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
shaped in a mould, and weighing about half a pound
each, served as small change; eighty such pieces were
equal in value to a <i lang="it">saggio</i> of fine gold, corresponding
to the Roman <i lang="la">solidus</i>, worth about three dollars. Salt
was, moreover, used as money at this time in Yun-Nan
and other provinces of southwestern China.<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>Felix Dubois, in his “Timbuctoo the Mysterious,”
p. 123, comments on the rarity of salt in the interior of
the Soudan, and says that it is the most valuable commodity
of that region, the <em>true gold</em> of the Soudanese.
The bulk of the salt supply of Timbuctoo comes from
the salt mines of Taudeny, which are situated in the
great Sahara desert, some three hundred miles away to
the north. Here the salt is found in abundance beneath
a scanty layer of sand, and is dug up in lumps and
fashioned into blocks. Small pieces of this rock-salt
are useful to the traveler as money, and are readily
accepted as such by the Soudanese merchants.</p>

<p>The camels of southern Mongolia require a certain
amount of salt in order to remain in good condition.
Instinctively, therefore, they browse upon the saline
efflorescence which is found on the grassy plains or
steppes of Asia. Baron Humboldt, in his “Aspects of
Nature” (Berlin, 1808), wrote that these plains were covered
with juicy, evergreen soda plants; and that many
of them glistened from afar with flakes of exuded salt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
which much resembled newly fallen snow. When
camels do not find this efflorescence, they sometimes
show their craving for its saline flavor by taking white
stones in their mouths, supposing them to be lumps of
salt.<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p>Owing to the universality of its use, salt has been
termed the “cosmopolitan condiment.” The craving
for this substance is not confined to man, but is shared
by the lower animals, and its hygienic value for horses
and cows is well known. Wild animals travel long distances
over deserts and prairies, or through swamps and
jungles, to reach “salt-licks.”</p>

<p>It may be that this natural craving for salt, which
is common to man and beast, may have suggested a
custom of etiquette in Abyssinia. For when a native of
that country desires to pay an especially delicate attention
to a friend or guest, he produces a piece of rock-salt,
and graciously permits the latter to lick it with his
tongue; a custom not a whit more ridiculous than the
ceremonious offering of snuff and the social sneeze of
modern civilization.</p>

<p>In certain portions of the Dark Continent salt is
esteemed a great luxury, and is relished by native children
quite as keenly as candy in more favored lands.</p>

<p>In the region of Accra, on the coast of Guinea, salt
is said to rank next to gold in value; and according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Mungo Park, among the Mandingos and Bambarras,
west African tribes, whose members are unusually intelligent,
the phrase, “flavoring one’s food with salt,”
implies the possession of wealth.<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<p>The Namaquas, inhabitants of the Hottentot country,
share so little the sentiments of their neighbors
regarding salt that they consider it a superfluous
article having no value whatever.</p>

<p>About the year 1830 there appeared in England a
volume by a certain Doctor Howard, with the following
curious title: “Salt, the forbidden fruit or food; and
the chief cause of diseases of the body and mind of
man and of animals, as taught by the ancient Egyptian
priests and wise men and by scripture, in accordance
with the author’s experience of many years.”<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>As may well be imagined from its title, this book
treats of salt as a most obnoxious substance, abstinence
from which as an article of diet is essential to the maintenance
of health.</p>

<p>The use of salt as an article of food was, moreover,
thought to render one irascible and melancholic, and in
illustration of this view may be quoted the following
passage from “Euphues and his England,” by John
Lyly, Maister of Arte (1580):—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>In sooth, gentlemen, I seldome eate salte for feare of anger,
and if you give me in token that I want wit, then will you
make cholericke before I eate it; for women, be they never
so foolish, would ever be thought wise.</p>

<p>I staied not long for mine answer, but as well quickened by
her former talke as desirous to cry quittance for her present
tongue, said thus: “If to eat store of <em>salt</em>, cause one to fret;
and to have no <em>salt</em>, signifies lack of wit, then do you cause
me to marvel, that eating no <em>salt</em>, you are so captious; and
loving no <em>salt</em>, you are so wise, when indeed so much wit is
sufficient for a woman, as when she is in the raine can warne
her to come out of it.”<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In a recent article in the “Journal of Hygiene,” the
writer affirms that the general belief in the necessity of
the use of salt for the maintenance of health is mischievous;
for many people, in their zeal to make the
most of a good thing, are wont to eat salt as a seasoner
of all kinds of food. Thus an abnormal craving for
the saline flavor is acquired and the condiment is used
in excess, thereby unduly taxing the secretory organs,
whereas in reality but a small quantity of salt is requisite.
Persons addicted to the so-called “salt habit”
have a perverted taste, and are naturally total failures
as epicures; for how can any one assume to be a dainty
feeder who disguises the true flavor of every dish, and
whose palate refuses to be tickled by the choicest morsels,
unless these smack strongly of salt?</p>

<p>But even in our times the use of salt as a relish is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
sometimes deprecated as unnecessary, if not positively
harmful. Thus it is argued that this substance arrests
or retards the physiological processes of disintegration
and renewal of the cells which compose the tissues of
the living body, processes essential to the maintenance
of life and health.</p>

<p>A recent advocate of this theory maintains that the
fondness for salt shown by some domesticated animals
is due to an acquired taste rather than to an instinctive
craving; for dogs and cats easily grow to like such
artificial products as ice-cream and beer. As to the
occasional visits of wild animals to salt-licks, the fact
that such visits are comparatively infrequent has been
thought to prove that these animals periodically require
the medicinal effects of saline waters, on the same
principle which leads people of wealth and fashion to
visit certain spas of Europe or America. The writer
above mentioned suggests that, whereas each article
of food has its own individual flavor, the addition of
salt makes them all taste alike. And if an inveterate
user of salt will forego this favorite condiment for a
month, he will then for the first time be enabled properly
to appreciate the true flavors of meats and vegetables.<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p>In the “Revelations of Egyptian Mysteries,” by
Robert Howard, the use of salt as a relish is characterized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
as an infringement of that law of nature which
forbids animals to partake of mineral substances as
food. History may, indeed, vouch for the antiquity of
the custom, but can furnish no proof of its propriety.
Indeed, the writer alleges in the above work that salt
is a most pernicious substance, and the direct cause of
many ills.</p>

<p>The idea conveyed by the phrase, “Enough is as good
as a feast,” applies in full force to the use of salt as a
condiment, for an excess of this substance in one’s food
certainly spoils its flavor. According to one version of
a Roumanian forest-myth, a prince, while following the
chase, came upon a beautiful laurel-tree, whose branches
were of a golden hue. This tree so pleased his fancy
that he determined to have his dinner beneath its shade,
and gave orders to that effect. Preparations were made
accordingly; but during the temporary absence of the
cook, a fair maiden emerged from the tree and strewed
a quantity of salt upon the viands, after which she re-entered
the tree, which closed over her. When the
prince returned and began eating his dinner, he scolded
the cook for using too much salt, and the cook quite
naturally protested his innocence.</p>

<p>On the following day the same thing occurred, and
the prince thereupon determined to keep watch, in
order if possible to detect the culprit. On the third
day, when the maiden came forth from the tree on mischief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
bent, the prince caught her and carried her away,
and she became his loyal wife.<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>This section may be appropriately concluded with
the following translation of a Roman legend illustrating
the value of common salt as an article of food:<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>—</p>

<p class="center"><i>The Value of Salt. A Roman Folk-tale.</i></p>

<p>There was once a king who had three daughters, and he
was very anxious to know which of them loved him most; he
tried them in various ways, and it always seemed as if the
youngest daughter came out best by the test. Yet he was
never satisfied, because he was prepossessed with the idea that
the elder ones loved him most.</p>

<p>One day he thought he would settle the matter once for all,
by asking each separately how much she loved him. So he
called the eldest by herself, and asked her how much she
loved him.</p>

<p>“As much as the bread we eat,” was her reply; and he
said within himself, “She must, as I thought, love me the
most of all; for bread is the first necessary of our existence,
without which we cannot live. She means, therefore, that
she loves me so much she could not live without me.”</p>

<p>Then he called the second daughter by herself, and said to
her, “How much do you love me?”</p>

<p>And she answered, “As much as wine.”</p>

<p>“That is a good answer too,” said the king to himself.
“It is true she does not seem to love me quite so much as the
eldest; but still, scarcely can one live without wine, so that
there is not much difference.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he called the youngest by herself, and said to her,
“And you, how much do you love me?”</p>

<p>And she answered, “As much as salt.”</p>

<p>Then the king said, “What a contemptible comparison!
She only loves me as much as the cheapest and commonest
thing that comes to the table. This is as much as to say, she
doesn’t love me at all. I always thought it was so. I will
never see her again.”</p>

<p>Then he ordered that a wing of the palace should be shut
up from the rest, where she should be served with everything
belonging to her condition in life, but where she should live
by herself apart, and never come near him.</p>

<p>Here she lived, then, all alone. But though her father
fancied she did not care for him, she pined so much at being
kept away from him, that at last she was worn out, and could
bear it no longer.</p>

<p>The room that had been given her had no windows on the
street, that she might not have the amusement of seeing what
was going on in the town, but they looked upon an inner
court-yard. Here she sometimes saw the cook come out and
wash vegetables at the fountain.</p>

<p>“Cook, cook!” she called one day, as she saw him pass
thus under the window.</p>

<p>The cook looked up with a good-natured face, which gave
her encouragement.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think, cook, I must be very lonely and miserable
up here all alone?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Signorina,” he replied; “I often think I should like
to help you to get out; but I dare not think of it, the king
would be so angry.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want you to do anything to disobey the king,”
answered the princess; “but would you really do me a favor,
which would make me very grateful indeed?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Signorina, anything which I can do without disobeying
the king,” replied the faithful servant.</p>

<p>“Then this is it,” said the princess. “Will you just oblige
me so far as to cook papa’s dinner to-day without any salt in
anything? Not the least grain in anything at all. Let it be
as good a dinner as you like, but no salt in anything. Will
you do that?”</p>

<p>“I see,” replied the cook, with a knowing nod. “Yes,
depend on me, I will do it.”</p>

<p>That day at dinner the king had no salt in the soup, no
salt in the boiled meat, no salt in the roast, no salt in the
fried.</p>

<p>“What is the meaning of this?” said the king, as he
pushed dish after dish away from him. “There is not a
single thing I can eat to-day. I don’t know what they have
done to everything, but there is not a single thing that has
got the least taste. Let the cook be called.”</p>

<p>So the cook came before him.</p>

<p>“What have you done to the victuals to-day?” said the
king sternly. “You have sent up a lot of dishes, and no one
alive can tell one from another. They are all of them exactly
alike, and there is not one of them can be eaten. Speak!”</p>

<p>The cook answered:—</p>

<p>“Hearing your Majesty say that salt was the commonest
thing that comes to table, and altogether so worthless and
contemptible, I considered in my mind whether it was a thing
that at all deserved to be served up to the table of the king;
and, judging that it was not worthy, I abolished it from the
king’s kitchen, and dressed all the meats without it. Barring
this, the dishes are the same that are sent every day to the
table of the king.”</p>

<p>Then the king understood the value of salt, and he comprehended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
how great was the love of his youngest child for him;
so he sent and had her apartment opened, and called her to
him, never to go away any more.</p>

</div>

<h3>X. THE SALT-CELLAR</h3>

<p>The rhetorician Arnobius, in his work “Disputationes
contra Gentes,” wrote that the pagans were wont to
sanctify or hallow their tables by setting salt-cellars
thereon. For owing to the fact that salt was employed
at every sacrifice as an offering to the gods, and owing
moreover to its reputed divine attributes, receptacles
containing salt were also held sacred.</p>

<p>Indeed, the salt-cellar partook of the nature of a
holy vessel, associated with the temple in general, and
more particularly with the altar.<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>Pythagoras said that salt was the emblem of justice;
for as it preserves all things and prevents corruption,
so justice preserves whatever it animates, and without
it all is corrupted. He therefore directed that a salt-cellar
should be placed upon the table at every meal, in
order to remind men of this emblematic virtue of salt.<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p>The Romans considered salt to be a sacred article of
food, and it was a matter of religious principle with
them to see that no other dish was placed upon the
table before the salt was in position.<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> A shell served<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
as a receptacle for salt on the table of the Roman
peasant, but at the repast of the wealthy citizen the
silver salt-cellar, which was usually an heirloom, was
placed in the middle of the table; and the same custom
prevailed in England in mediæval times.</p>

<p>In a work entitled “Antiquitates Culinariæ,” compiled
by the Rev. Richard Warner, London, 1791, are
to be found, reprinted from an old paper-roll, elaborate
directions for the preparation of the banquet-table
on the occasion of a great feast at the enthroning of
George Neville as Chancellor of England and Archbishop
of York in the sixth year of Edward the Fourth,
<span class="smcapuc">A. D</span>. 1466.</p>

<p>After the laying of the “chiefe napkin,” the officials
of the king’s household charged with such duties were
directed to bring salt, bread, and trenchers, and to
“set the salt right under the middest of the cloth of
estate.”</p>

<p>Minute directions follow regarding the proper disposition
of the trenchers, knives, spoons, and bread,
and their exact relations to the salt, which was treated
with special deference throughout the ceremony.</p>

<p>The Hon. Horace Walpole published an account of
the formalities observed at the “setting” of Queen
Elizabeth’s dinner-table, as described by a German
traveler who was present on such an occasion. After
the table-cloth had been spread two gentlemen appeared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
one bearing a rod and the other having a salt-cellar, a
plate, and bread. After kneeling three times with the
utmost reverence, they placed these three articles upon
the table and withdrew. Later in the ceremony came
an unmarried lady dressed in white silk, and a matron
carrying a tasting-knife. The former, having thrice
prostrated herself, approached the table in the most
graceful manner, and rubbed with bread and salt the
plates provided for the guests. After this the yeomen
of the guard, clad in scarlet, and each with a golden
rose upon his back, entered bare-headed, bringing a
course of four-and-twenty dishes. In the households
of the English nobility a similar custom prevailed. A
rhythmical code of instructions to servants of the
fifteenth century required that the salt should always
be the first article placed on the festive board after the
cloth was laid:<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>—</p>

<p>A curious little treatise, with the title “How to serve
a Lord,” specifies how the principal salt-cellar shall be
placed:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Thenne here-uppon the boteler or panter shall bring forthe
his pryncipall salte … he shall sette the saler in the myddys
of the tabull accordyng to the place where the principall
soverain shall sette … thenne the seconde salte att the
lower ende … then salte selers shall be sette uppon the
syde tablys.</p>

</div>

<p>The custom of placing salt upon the table before all
else is thought to have originated in the ancient conception
of this substance as the symbol of friendship;
and indeed no banquet, however elaborate, was complete
without it. The salt was, moreover, the last article to
be removed from the hospitable board.</p>

<p>It was as though our forefathers thereby intended
that the guests, seeing salt on the table, might realize
that they were “invited in love and were loved before
they came;” and the fact that it was allowed to remain
after the other dishes had been removed might serve
to remind them that while feasts, like many other good
things, come to an end, love and friendship may be
perpetual.<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>

<p>Macrobius wrote, in the fifth century <span class="smcapuc">A. D.</span>, that the
ancients did not consider themselves as either welcome
or safe at a banquet unless the salt and the shrines of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
their gods were placed upon the table; the former indicating
a cordial greeting, and the latter being a guarantee
of protection.</p>

<p>The ancient “Boke of Keruynge” says: “Than
set your salt on the ryght syde where your soverayne
shall sytte, and on ye lefte syde the salte set your
trenchours.”</p>

<p>Mediæval salt-cellars were often elaborate pieces of
silver. In Paul Lacroix’s “Manners, Customs, and Dress
during the Middle Ages” are illustrations of an enameled
silver salt-cellar with six facings, representing the
labors of Hercules, which was made at Limoges for
the French king, Francis I., in the early part of the sixteenth
century. At Corpus Christi College, Cambridge,
England, is preserved an elegantly wrought silver and
golden salt-cellar which belonged to Matthew Parker,
who was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury in 1558.<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>In the “Art Journal” (vol. xxxix. 1887) is a description
of the state salt-cellar of Mostyn Hall, Flintshire,
North Wales, which had been recently discovered in an
ancient chest. This magnificent piece of plate, which
bears the London date-mark 1586-87, is eighteen and
one half inches in height and of cylindrical form, surmounted
by a vase, and richly ornamented with groups
of fruit, foliage, animals, and birds.</p>

<p>In mediæval England the chief salt-cellar was sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
in the form of a silver ship, thus suggesting both
the briny deep and the craft which sails thereon.</p>

<p>King Henry III. ordered twenty silver salts in the
year 1243.<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<p>In the room containing the crown jewels, in the
Tower of London, are to be seen eleven magnificent
golden salt-cellars, the oldest dating from the reign of
Elizabeth. Of these the so-called state salt-cellar,
which is a model of the White Tower, was presented
by the city of Exeter to King Charles II., and was
used at coronation banquets.</p>

<p>Descriptions and illustrations of old English salt-cellars
of different epochs are to be found in a volume
entitled “Old English Plate,” by Wilfred Joseph
Cripps, M. A., F. S. A., London, 1886; and in “Old
Plate,” by J. H. Buck, New York, 1888. In the former
work mention is made of a magnificent salt-cellar,
“in the form of an olifaunt,” the property of John,
Earl of Warrenes, in 1347; and another, “in the shape
of a dog,” belonging to Edmund Mortimer, Earl of
March, in 1380.</p>

<p>From an early period until the close of the seventeenth
century, the rank of guests at a banquet in
wealthy households, as in the halls of country squires,
in England, was indicated by the situation of their
places at table with reference to the massive silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
centre-pieces which contained the salt,<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> sometimes called
the “salt-vat” or “salt-foot.”</p>

<p>At the head of the table, which was called <em>the board’s
end</em>, and “above the salt,” sat the host and his more
distinguished guests; and during the reigns of Henry
VII. and VIII. it was enjoined upon the ushers to
see that no person occupied a higher place than he was
entitled to. Probably no penalty was imposed upon
guests who unwittingly selected a more honorable seat
than their rank warranted, other than removal to a
lower position. But in the less civilized era of the
eleventh century, the laws of King Canute provided
that any person sitting at a banquet above his position
should be “pelted out of his place by bones, at the
discretion of the company, without the privilege of
taking offense.”<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>In a book called “Strange Foot-Post, with a Packet
full of Strange Petitions,” by Nixon (London, 1613),
the author says in reference to a poor scholar:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Now, as for his fare, it is lightly at the cheapest table, but
he must sit under the salt, that is an axiome in such places;
then having drawne his knife leisurably, unfolded his napkin
mannerly after twice or thrice wiping his beard, if he have it,
he may reach the bread on his knife’s point.</p>

</div>

<p>The “Babees Book” (1475) says: “The salt also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
touch not in his salere with nokyns mete, but lay it honestly
on the Trenchoure, for that is curtesy;” and the
“Young Children’s Book” (1500) contains this passage:
“It was not graceful to take the salt except with the clene
knyfe; far less to dip your meat into the salt-cellar.”</p>

<p>Joseph Hall, in his “Satires” (1597), speaking of the
conditions imposed by a gentle squire upon his son’s
tutor, says that the latter was required to sleep in a
trundle-bed at the foot of his young master’s couch, and
that his seat at table was invariably “below the salt.”</p>

<p>Again, in a volume of “Essayes,” by Sir William
Cornwallis (1632), occurs the following:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>There is another sort worse than these, that never utter
anything of their owne, but get jests by heart, and rob bookes
and men of prettie tales, and yet hope for this to have a
roome <em>above the salt</em>.</p>

</div>

<p>Quite apropos to our subject are the words of an old
English ballad:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Thou art a carle of mean degree,</div>
<div class="verse">Ye salt doth stand twain me and thee.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The following passage from Smyth’s “Lives of the
Berkeleys” refers to Lord Henry Berkeley, who dwelt
in Caludon Castle, near Coventry, in Warwickshire, in
the latter part of the sixteenth century, and may serve
to illustrate the importance of the central salt-cellar as
a boundary:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>At Christmas and other festivals when his neighbors were
feasted in his hall, he would, in the midst of their dinner, rise
from his own, and going to each of their tables, cheerfully bid
them welcome; and when guests of honor and high rank
filled his own table, he seated himself at the lower end; and
when such guests filled but half his board and those of meaner
degree the other half, he would take his own seat between
them in the midst of his long table <em>near the salt</em>, which
gracious considerate acts did much to gain the love that his
people had for him.</p>

</div>

<p>And in commenting on this passage a recent writer
remarks that his haughty wife, Lady Katherine, high-born
and beautiful and clever though she was, could
hardly be imagined as sitting “below the salt,” out of
consideration for the feelings of an inferior.<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p>In the houses of well-to-do farmers among the Scottish
peasantry in the latter part of the eighteenth century,
a linen cloth was sometimes spread over the upper
portion of the dinner-table, where sat the farmer and
the members of his family. Quite commonly, however,
a chalk-line divided this end of the board from the
lower portion where the hired laborers were seated;
and in the more pretentious households the salt-dish
served as a boundary.<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>In “Nares’ Glossary,” vol. ii. p. 763, under the heading
“Above or Below the Salt,” the writer comments
on the invidious distinctions formerly made between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
guests seated at the same table, and quotes as follows
from Ben Jonson’s “Cynthia’s Revels” in reference to
a conceited fop:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>His fashion is not to take knowledge of him that is beneath
him in clothes; he never drinks below the Salt.</p>

</div>

<p>The Innholders Company still adheres to the custom
of indicating rank and social position at table by means
of a handsome salt-cellar of the time of James I., to
which is assigned the responsible function of dividing
the Court from the Livery at the Livery dinners; the
latter occupying the seats corresponding to those of the
retainers in the old-time baron’s hall.<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p>Among the Puritans in New England “the salt-cellar
was the focus of the old-time board.” Our ancestors
brought with them from beyond the sea, not only the
ideas regarding table etiquette prevalent in the old
country, but also such tangible vanities as silver plate.
Miss Alice Morse Earle, in her book on the “Customs
and Fashions of Old New England,” says that the
“standing salt” was often the handsomest article of
table furniture, and mentions among the belongings of
Comfort Starr, of Boston, in 1659, a “greate silver-gilt
double salt-cellar.” Early in the eighteenth century
these ponderous silver vessels were superseded by the
little “trencher salts,” of various patterns, which are
still in use.</p>

<p>He is a friend at sneezing time; the most that can be got from him is

<h3>I. IN ANCIENT TIMES</h3>

<p>The ancient Egyptians regarded the head as a citadel
or fortress in which the reasoning faculty abode.<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>
Hence they especially revered any function seemingly
appertaining to so noble a portion of the body, and
dignified even the insignificant act of sneezing by
attributing to it auguries for good or evil, according to
the position of the moon with reference to the signs
of the zodiac.<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> The Greeks and Romans also, by
whom the most trivial occurrences of every-day life
were thought to be omens of good fortune or the
reverse, considered the phenomena of sneezing as not
the least important in this regard. Homer tells us in
the Odyssey that the Princess Penelope, troubled by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the importunities of her suitors, prayed to the gods for
the speedy return of her husband Ulysses. Scarcely
was her prayer ended when her son Telemachus sneezed,
and this event was regarded by Penelope as an intimation
that her petition would be granted.</p>

<p>Aristotle said that there was a god of sneezing, and
that when in Greece any business enterprise was to be
undertaken, two or four sneezes were thought to be
favorable. If more than four, the auspices were indifferent,
while one or three rendered it hazardous to
proceed.<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> About this, however, there appears to have
been no unvarying rule. Sneezing at a banquet was
considered by the Romans to be especially ominous;
and when it unfortunately occurred, some of the viands
were brought back to the table and again tasted, as
this was thought to counteract any evil effects. The
Greeks considered that the brain controlled the function
of sneezing. They were therefore as careful to
avoid eating this portion of any animal as the Pythagoreans
were to avoid beans as an article of diet.<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p>It is related that just before the battle of Salamis,
<span class="smcapuc">B. C.</span> 480, and while Themistocles, the Athenian commander,
was offering a sacrifice to the gods on the deck
of his galley, a sneeze was heard on the right hand,
which was hailed as a fortunate omen by Euphrantides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the Soothsayer. Again, it happened once that while
Xenophon was addressing his soldiers, referring to the
righteousness of their cause and the consequent divine
favor which might be expected, some one chanced to
sneeze. Pausing in his address, the great general
remarked that Jupiter had been pleased to send them a
happy omen, and it seemed therefore but right to make
an offering to the gods. Then, after all the company
had joined in a hymn of thanksgiving, the sacrifice was
made, and Xenophon continued with his exhortation.</p>

<p>Among the ancients sneezing to the right was considered
fortunate and to the left unlucky. In some
erotic verses with the title “Acme and Septimius,” by
the Roman poet, Catullus (<span class="smcapuc">B. C.</span> 87-47), are these lines,
twice repeated:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Love stood listening with delight,</div>
<div class="verse">And sneezed his auspice on the right.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The omens of sneezing were thought to be of especial
significance in lovers’ affairs, and indeed the classic
poets were wont to say of beautiful women that Love
had sneezed at their birth. The Italian poet, Propertius,
while asserting his enduring affection for Cynthia, the
daughter of the poet Hostius, thus apostrophizes the
chief theme of his eulogies: “In thy new-born days,
my life, did golden Love sneeze loud and clear a favoring
omen.”</p>

<p>The Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans regarded the act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
of sneezing as a kind of divinity or oracle, which warned
them on various occasions as to the course they should
pursue, and also foretold future good or evil.<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<p>Plutarch said that the familiar spirit or demon of
Socrates was simply the sneezing either of the philosopher
himself or of those about him. If any person in
his company sneezed on his right hand, Socrates felt
encouraged to proceed with the project or enterprise
which he may have had in mind. But if the sneeze
were on his left hand, he abandoned the undertaking.
If he himself sneezed when he was doubtful whether or
not to do anything, he regarded it as evidence in the
affirmative; but if he happened to sneeze after any
work was already entered upon, he immediately desisted
therefrom.<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> The demon, we are told, always notified
him by a slight sneeze whenever his wife Xantippe was
about to have a scolding fit, so that he was thus enabled
opportunely to absent himself. And in so doing
Socrates appears to have given proof, were any needed,
of his superior wisdom; for Xantippe had been known
to upset the supper-table in her anger, and that, too,
when a guest was present.</p>

<p>On a column in the garden of the House of the
Faun, at Pompeii, there is a Latin inscription which
may be freely translated as follows:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Victoria, good luck to thee and wherever thou wilt, sneeze
pleasantly.<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Clement of Alexandria, in a treatise on politeness,
characterizes sneezing as effeminate and as a sign of
intemperance.</p>

<p>Probably the only Biblical reference to the subject
of sneezing is in 2 Kings iv. 35, where the son of the
Shunamite sneezed seven times and then revived at the
prayer of Elisha.</p>

<p>Hor-Apollo, in his treatise on Egyptian hieroglyphics,
says that the inhabitants of ancient Egypt believed that
the capacity for sneezing was in inverse ratio to the
size of the spleen; and they portrayed the dog as the
personification of sneezing and smelling, because they
believed that that animal had a very small spleen. On
the other hand, they held that animals with large
spleens were unable to sneeze, smell, or laugh, that is,
to be open, blithe, or frank-hearted.<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<p>The function of the spleen in the animal economy is
not fully understood to-day. If the above theory were
correct, we should expect that the removal of a dog’s
spleen would incite excessive sternutation and render
more acute the sense of smell, whereas the only marked
result of the operation is a voracious appetite. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
theory is certainly unique, as well as illogical and
absurd.</p>

<p>St. Augustine wrote that, in his time, so prevalent
was faith in the omens of sneezing that a man would
return to bed if he happened to sneeze while putting
on his shoes in the morning.</p>

<p>The learned English prelate, Alcuin (735-804), expressed
the opinion that sneezings were devoid of value
as auguries except to those who placed reliance in them.
But he further remarked that “it was permitted to the
evil spirit, for the deceiving of persons who observe
these things, to cause that in some degree prognostics
should often foretell the truth.”<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p>In an ancient Anglo-Saxon sermon, a copy of which
is in the library of Cambridge University, England,
reference is made to certain superstitions existing
among the Saxons before their conversion to Christianity.
The writer says: “Every one who trusts in divinations,
either by fowls or by sneezings, or by horses or
dogs, he is no Christian, but a notorious apostate.”</p>

<h3>II. MEDIÆVAL BELIEFS ABOUT SNEEZING</h3>

<p>From certain ancient Welsh poems, it appears that
sneezing was considered unlucky in Wales in the
twelfth century;<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> but in Europe generally, in mediæval<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
times, the sneeze of a cat on the eve of a wedding was
reckoned auspicious.<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> In the writings of the French
poet, Pierre de Ronsard (1524-85), the opinion is expressed
that not to sneeze while regarding the sun is
a sign of ill-luck; and from Doctor Hartlieb’s “Book
of all Forbidden Arts, Unbelief, and Sorcery,” 1455,
we learn that in Germany there was a popular belief
that three sneezes indicated the presence of four thieves
around the house.</p>

<p>Jerome Cardan, the noted Italian philosopher and
physician (1501-76), in speaking of genii or familiar
spirits, remarked that, in his opinion, sneezing was a
supernatural phenomenon, and, like the sound of ringing
in the ears, was premonitory of some event of
importance.<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p>Some idea of the credulous notions on the subject
of sneezing which were prevalent in England during
Queen Elizabeth’s reign may be obtained from the following
extracts from the “Burghley Papers,” Lansdowne
MSS. (No. 121) in the British Museum.<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<h3>III. MODERN SUPERSTITIONS ABOUT SNEEZING</h3>

<p>Sneezing at the commencement of an undertaking,
whether it be an important enterprise or the most
commonplace act, has usually been accounted unlucky.
Thus, according to a modern Teutonic belief, if a man
sneeze on getting up in the morning, he should lie
down again for another three hours, else his wife will
be his master for a week.<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> So likewise the pious
Hindu, who may perchance sneeze while beginning
his morning ablutions in the river Ganges, immediately
recommences his prayers and toilet; and among the
Alfoorans or aborigines of the island of Celebes in the
Indian archipelago, if one happens to sneeze when about
leaving a gathering of friends, he at once resumes his
seat for a while before making another start.<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>When a native of the Banks Islands, in Polynesia,
sneezes, he imagines that some one is calling his name,
either with good or evil intent, the motive being shown
by the character of the sneeze. Thus a gentle sneeze
implies kindly feeling on the part of the person speaking
of him, while a violent paroxysm indicates a malediction.</p>

<p>In the latter case he resorts to a peculiar form of
divination in order to ascertain who it is that curses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
him. This consists in raising the arms above the head
and revolving the closed fists one around the other.
The revolution of the fists is the question, “Is it such
an one?” Then the arms are thrown out, and the
answer, presumably affirmative, is given by the cracking
of the elbow-joints.<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p>In Scotland even educated people have been known
to maintain that idiots are incapable of sneezing,<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> and
hence, if this be true, the inference is clear that the
act of sternutation is <i lang="la">prima facie</i> evidence of the
possession of a certain degree of intelligence.</p>

<p>British nurses used to think that infants were under
a fairy spell until they sneezed. “God sain the bairn,”
exclaimed an old Scotch nurse when her little charge
sneezed at length, “it’s no a warlock.”</p>

<p>The Irish people also entertain similar beliefs. Thus
in Lady Wilde’s “Ancient Cures, Charms, and Usages
of Ireland” (p. 41) is to be found the following description
of a magical ceremony for the cure of a fairy-stricken
child. A good fire is made, wherein is thrown
a quantity of certain herbs prescribed by the fairy
women; and after a thick smoke has risen, the child is
carried thrice around the fire while an incantation is
repeated and holy water is sprinkled about liberally.
Meantime all doors must be closed, lest some inquisitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
fairy enter and spy upon the proceedings; and the
magical rites must be continued <em>until the child sneezes
three times</em>, for this looses the spell, and the little one
is permanently redeemed from the power of witches.</p>

<p>Among uncivilized peoples the sneeze of a young
child has a certain mystic significance, and is intimately
associated with its prospective welfare or ill-luck.
When, therefore, a Maori infant sneezes, its mother immediately
recites a long charm of words. If the sneeze
occurs during a meal, it is thought to be prognostic of
a visit, or of some interesting piece of news; whereas
in Tonga it is deemed an evil token.</p>

<p>So, too, among the New Zealanders, if a child sneeze
on the occasion of receiving its name, the officiating
priest at once holds to its ear the wooden image of an
idol and sings some mystic words.</p>

<p>In a note appended to his “Mountain Bard,” the
Ettrick Shepherd says, regarding the superstitions of
Selkirkshire: “When they sneeze in first stepping out
of bed in the morning, they are thence certified that
strangers will be there in the course of the day, in
numbers corresponding to the times they sneeze.”<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>It was a Flemish belief that a sneeze during a conversation
proved that what one said was the truth,<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
doctrine which must have commended itself to snuff-takers.</p>

<p>In Shetlandic and Welsh folk-lore the sneeze of a
cat indicates cold north winds in summer and snow in
winter;<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> and the Bohemians have an alleged infallible
test for recognizing the Devil, for they believe that he
must perforce sneeze violently at sight of a cross.<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<p>According to a Chinese superstition a sneeze on
New Year’s Eve is ominous for the coming year; and,
to offset this, the sneezer must visit three families of
different surnames, and beg from each a small tortoise-shaped
cake, which must be eaten before midnight.<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

<p>In Turkistan, when a person to whom a remark is
addressed sneezes, it is an asseveration that the opinion
or statement is correct, just as if the person accosted
were to exclaim, “That is true!” In the same country
three sneezes are unlucky. When, also, any one hiccoughs,
it is etiquette to say, “You stole something
from me,” and this phrase at such times is supposed to
produce good luck.<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>The Japanese attach significance to the number of
times a man sneezes. Thus, one sneeze indicates that
some one is praising him, while two betoken censure or
disparagement; a triple sneeze is commonplace, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
means simply that a person has taken cold.<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> In Mexico,
also, it was formerly believed either that somebody was
speaking evil of one who sneezed, or that he was being
talked about by one or more persons.<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<p>Sussex people are prejudiced against cats which
develop sneezing proclivities, for they believe that,
when a pet feline sneezes thrice, it augurs ill for the
health of the household, and is premonitory of influenza
and bronchial affections.<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>In an interesting article in “Macmillan’s Magazine,”
entitled “From the Note-book of a Country Doctor,”<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>
a physician practicing in a remote part of Cornwall tells
of a peculiar cure for deafness which recently came to
his notice.</p>

<p>One of his patients, an elderly woman whose name
was Grace Rickard, complained that she could no
longer hear the grunting of her pigs, a sound which,
from childhood, had roused her from sleep in the early
morning. The doctor was obliged to tell her that the
difficulty was due to advancing years.</p>

<p>A short time after, on calling at her house, he found
her sitting before the fire with a piece of board in her
lap, and deeply absorbed in thought. Just as the door
opened, she exclaimed: “Lord, deliver me from my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
sins,” and this petition was followed by a peculiar noise
which sounded like an abortive sneeze. “Don’t be
frited, zur,” she said, “’tes aunly a sneeze.” “It’s
the oddest sneeze I ever heard,” said the doctor; “why
can’t you sneeze in the ordinary way?” “So I do,
when I can,” she explained; “but now ’tes got up to
nine times running, and wherever to get nine sneezes
from is moor ’n I knaw.”</p>

<p>It appeared that Grace was making trial of an infallible
cure for deafness, the necessary apparatus for
which consisted of a piece of board and some stout
pins. One of the latter is stuck into the board every
morning, the patient’s forefingers being crossed over
the pin, while the pious ejaculation above mentioned is
repeated simultaneously with a vigorous sneeze. On
the next morning two pins must be stuck in the board,
the petition and sneeze being once repeated; on the
following morning three pins, three prayers, and three
sneezes, and so on up to nine times.</p>

<h3>IV. THE DOCTRINE OF DEMONIACAL POSSESSION</h3>

<p>The natural instinct of the untutored savage is to
regard the act of sneezing as the manifestation of
an attack by a demon. Certain African tribes, for
instance, are said to believe that whoever sneezes is
possessed of an evil spirit, to whose malicious agency
is due the violence of the paroxysm and its utter disregard
of times and seasons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Edward B. Tylor, in his “Primitive Culture”
(vol. i. p. 97), asserts that the Zulus have faith in the
agency of kindly spirits as well, and says that, when
one of these people sneezes, he is wont to exclaim:
“I am now blessed; the ancestral spirit is with me.
Let me hasten and praise it, for it is that which causes
me to sneeze.” Thereupon he praises the spirits of
the dead, and asks for various blessings. But among
most uncivilized peoples sneezing is placed in the category
of paroxysmal diseases, and reckoned to be of
demoniac origin.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as sneezing is often one symptom of an
incipient cold, which is a physical ailment, and as
among savage tribes every physical ailment is regarded
as a case of demoniacal possession, the use of charms
and exorcisms to counteract the efforts of the evil
spirits seems a natural expedient.<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p>

<p>When an American Indian falls sick, he believes his
illness to be the work of some spiteful demon. Therefore,
when he gets well, he changes his name, so that
the demon may not be able to recognize him again.<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<p>The chief aim of the medicine-man, in treating
a patient, is the expulsion of the evil spirit; and this
is the prime object of the various superstitious ceremonies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
and incantations which are a prominent feature
in medical practice among savages.<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> The medicine-man
strives to drive away the demon by frightful
sounds and gesticulations, and by hideous grimaces and
contortions. Sometimes he makes a small image typifying
the spirit of sickness, and this image is then
maliciously broken in pieces.<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p>The natives of West Africa believe that the mere
mention of unpleasant names suffices to frighten away
the demons who cause sickness; and these spirits may
moreover be deceived by simply changing the name of
a sick child. In the province of Tonquin, a French
possession in southeastern Asia, hateful names given
to ailing children are likewise thought to terrify the
evil spirits; but when the little patients are convalescent,
pleasanter names are substituted.<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<p>The Indians of Nootka Sound, Vancouver Island,
attribute physical ailments either to the absence or
irregular conduct of the soul, or to the agency of
spirits, and medical practice is governed accordingly;
therefore the Okanogons of the State of Washington
subject patients affected with serious illnesses to the
magical treatment of the medicine-man.<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p>The islanders of the South Pacific have their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
doctrine about the philosophy of sneezing. They
believe that, when the spirit goes traveling about, its
return naturally occasions some commotion, as is evident
from the violent act of sneezing. They therefore
deem it proper to welcome back the wandering spirit,
the form of greeting varying in the different islands.
The phrase employed by the natives of Raratonga, for
example, means “Ha! you have come back!”<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p>The “Sadda,” one of the sacred books of the
Parsees, counsels the faithful to have recourse to
prayer when they sneeze, because at that critical moment
the demon is especially active.</p>

<p>The Parsees regard sneezing as a manifestation that
the evil spirits, who are constantly seeking to enter the
body, have been forcibly expelled by the interior fire
which, in their belief, animates every human being.
When, therefore, a Parsee hears any one sneeze, he
exclaims, “Blessed be Ormuzd!” thus praising his
chief deity. The Parsees are forbidden to talk while
eating, because at such times demons are on the alert,
watching for opportunities to gain admission to the
body through the mouth while a person is engaged in
conversation.<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>Pious Brahmins are careful to touch the right ear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
when they happen to sneeze either during the performance
of a religious ceremony or at certain other
times specified in the “Shastra,” or holy books of the
Hindus. Evil spirits were believed to enter the body
through the ears, as well as by the nose or mouth, and
the object of touching the ear was to prevent their
gaining admission there.</p>

<p>In reference to this subject, Gerald Massey says, in
the “Natural Genesis” (vol. i. pp. 83-85):—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Sneezing is not only a vigorous form of breathing, but it
is involuntary; hence inspired, or of extraordinary origin.
A hearty sneeze, when one is ill and faint, would imply a
sudden accession of the breathing power, which was inwardly
inspiring and outwardly expelling. The good spirit enters
and the bad spirit departs, cast out by the sudden impulsion.
The expulsion and repudiation implied in sneezing is yet
glanced at in the saying that such a thing is “not to be
sneezed at.”</p>

</div>

<p>The natives of Turkistan consider yawning to be
a reprehensible act, originating from an evil place in
one’s heart, and indicative of a state of preparedness
for the reception of demons. When, therefore, they
yawn, the hand is placed, palm outwards, before the
open mouth, thus barring out the demons.<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<p>The once popular opinion, which is still met with to-day,
that the efficacy of a medicine is proportionate to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
its harshness of flavor, is probably a relic of the ancient
theory which attributed illnesses to possession by evil
spirits. When one’s body was believed to be the
abode of such a spirit, the natural desire was to drive
out the unwelcome visitor, and to force him to seek
some other habitation. Nowadays we have so far
abandoned this theory that, while we may have faith
in the virtues of bitter herbs, we are ready to welcome
also the palatable remedies of the modern pharmacopœia;
but until comparatively recent times the science
of therapeutics was dominated by superstition, and
physicians prescribed remedies composed of the most
repulsive and uncanny ingredients.</p>

<p>In Tibet antiseptics are employed in surgical operations,
the rationale of their use in that country being
the preservation of the wound from evil spirits; and
when smallpox rages in the neighborhood of the city
of Leh, capital of the province of Ladakh, the country
people seek to ward off the epidemic by placing
thorns on their bridges and at their boundary lines.<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>
This practice is strikingly analogous in principle to
some of the superstitious uses of iron and steel in the
form of sharp instruments, of which mention has been
made elsewhere in this volume.</p>

<p>The aboriginal Tibetans ascribe illnesses to the spite
of demons, and hence a chief object of their religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
rites is the pacification of these malignant beings by
the sacrifice of a cow, pig, goat, or other animal.<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>Throughout Christendom it is customary for those
present to invoke the divine blessing upon a person
who sneezes, and the Moslem, under like circumstances,
prays to Allah for aid against the powers of evil. In
either case the underlying idea appears to be the same,
namely, the doctrine of invading spirits.</p>

<p>In ancient Egypt illnesses were thought to be caused
by demons who had somehow entered the patient’s
body and taken up their abode there; and the Chaldean
physicians, actuated by the same belief, were wont
to prescribe the most nauseating medicines in order to
thoroughly disgust the demon in possession, and thus
enforce his departure.<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p>This doctrine of spiritual possession was formerly
even supposed to be warranted by Scripture, and especially
by a verse of the 141st Psalm: “Set a watch, O
Lord, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.”
This passage was interpreted as an entreaty for preservation
from evil spirits, who were likely to enter the
body through the mouth,<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> especially during the acts of
yawning, sneezing, talking, and eating. The Hindus
consider yawning as dangerous for this reason, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
hence the practice of mouth-washing, which is a part
of their daily ritual. Hence also their custom of
cracking their fingers and exclaiming “Great God!”
after yawning, to intimidate the <i>Bhúts</i>, or malignant
spirits. Sneezing is usually accounted lucky in India,
except at the commencement of an undertaking, because
it means the expulsion of a <i>Bhút</i>.<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></p>

<p>Josephus relates having seen a Jew named Eleazar
exorcise devils from people who were possessed, in the
presence of the Emperor Vespasian and many of his
soldiers. His mode of procedure consisted in applying
to the demoniac’s nose a ring containing a piece of the
root of a magical herb, and then withdrawing the evil
spirit through the nostrils, meanwhile repeating certain
incantations originally composed by Solomon.</p>

<h3>V. SALUTATION AFTER SNEEZING</h3>

<p>The origin of the benediction after sneezing, a custom
well-nigh universal, is involved in obscurity. A
popular legend says that, before the time of Jacob, men
sneezed but once, as the shock proved fatal. The patriarch,
however, obtained by intercession a relaxation
of this law, on condition that every sneeze should be
consecrated by an ejaculatory prayer.<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> According to
a well-known myth of classical antiquity, Prometheus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
formed of clay the model of a man, and desiring to
animate the lifeless figure, was borne to heaven by
the Goddess Minerva, where he filled a reed with celestial
fire stolen from a wheel of the Sun’s chariot.
Returning then to earth, he applied the magical reed
to the nostrils of the image, which thereupon became
a living man, and began its existence by sneezing.
Prometheus, delighted with his success, uttered a fervent
wish for the welfare of his newly formed creature.
The latter thenceforward always repeated aloud the
same benediction whenever he heard any one sneeze,
and enjoined upon his children the same practice,
which was thus transmitted to succeeding generations.</p>

<p>Famianus Strada, the Italian Jesuit historian (1572-1649),
in his “Prolusiones Academicæ,” relates that
one day, when Cicero was present at a performance of
the Roman opera, he began to sneeze, whereupon the
entire audience, irrespective of rank, arose and with one
accord cried out, “God bless you!” or, as the common
phrase was, “May Jupiter be with thee!” Whereat
three young men named Fannius, Fabalus, and Lemniscus,
who were lounging in one of the boxes, began
an animated discussion in regard to the antiquity of
this custom, which all believed to have originated with
Prometheus.<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<p>Even in the time of Aristotle, salutation after sneezing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
was considered an ancient custom;<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> and references
to it are to be found in the writings of Roman authors.
Pliny narrates in his “Natural History” that the
Emperor Tiberius Cæsar, who was known as one of
the most melancholy and unsociable of men, scrupulously
exacted a benediction from his attendants whenever
he sneezed, whether in his palace or while driving
in his chariot; and Apuleius, the platonic philosopher
of the second century, alludes to the subject in his
story of “The Fuller’s Wife.”</p>

<p>Although the fact of the existence of this custom
centuries before the Christian era is beyond cavil, yet a
very general popular belief attributes its origin to a
much later period. The Italian historian, Carlo Sigonio,
voices this belief in his statement that the practice
began in the sixth century, during the pontificate of
Gregory the Great. At this period a virulent pestilence
raged in Italy, which proved fatal to those who sneezed.
The Pope, therefore, ordered prayers to be said against
it, accompanied by certain signs of the cross.<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> And
the people were wont also to say to those who sneezed,
“God help ye!”<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> a revival of a custom dating back to
prehistoric times.</p>

<p>Again, Jacobus de Voragine (1230-98) wrote as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
follows in the “Golden Legend,” a popular religious
work of the Middle Ages:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>For a right grete and grevous maladye: for as the Romayns
had in the lenton lyved sobrely and in contynence, and after
at Ester had receyvd theyr Savyour; after they disordered
them in etyng, in drynkyng, in playes, and in lecherye. And
therefore our Lord was meuyed ayenst them and sent them
a grete pestelence, which was called the Botche of impedymye,
and that was cruell and sodayne, and caused peple to dye
in goyng by the waye, in pleying, in leeying atte table, and
in spekyng one with another sodeynly they deyed. In this
manere somtyme snesyng they deyed; so that whan any persone
was herd snesyng, anone they that were by said to hym,
<i>God helpe you</i>, or <i>Cryst helpe</i>, and yet endureth the custome.
And also whan he sneseth or gapeth, he maketh to fore his
face the signe of the crosse and blessith hym. And yet
endureth this custome.</p>

</div>

<p>The Icelander, when he sneezes, says, “God help
me!” and to another person who sneezes he says,
“God help you!” In Icelandic tradition the custom
dates from a remote period, when the Black Pest raged
virulently in portions of the country, and the mortality
therefrom was great. At length the scourge reached a
certain farm where lived a brother and sister, and they
observed that the members of the household who succumbed
to the disease were first attacked by a violent
paroxysm of sneezing; therefore they were wont to exclaim
“God help me!” when they themselves sneezed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Of all the inhabitants of that district, these two were
the only ones who survived the pest, and hence the
Icelanders, throughout succeeding generations, have
continued the pious custom thus originated.<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>In mediæval German poetry are to be found occasional
references to this subject, as in the following passage
quoted in Grimm’s “Teutonic Mythology:” “The
pagans durst not sneeze, even though one should say,
‘God help thee.’” And in the same work allusion is
made to a quaint bit of fairy-lore about enchanted
sprites sneezing under a bridge, that some one may call
out “God help,” and undo the spell.</p>

<p>In the year 1542 the Spanish explorer, Hernando de
Soto, received a visit in Florida from a native chief
named Guachoya, and during their interview the latter
sneezed. Immediately his attendants arose and saluted
him with respectful gestures, at the same time saying:
“May the Sun guard thee, be with thee, enlighten
thee, magnify thee, protect thee, favor thee,” and other
similar good wishes. And the Spaniards who were
present were impressed by the fact that, in connection
with sneezing, even more elaborate ceremonies were
observed by savage tribes than those which obtained
among civilized nations. And hence they reasoned
that such observances were natural and instinctive with
all mankind.<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> We have the testimony of the earliest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
English explorers that the custom of salutation after
sneezing was common in the remotest portions of
Africa and in the far East. Speke and Grant were
unable to discover any trace of religion among the
natives of equatorial Africa, except in their practice of
uttering an Arabic ejaculation or prayer whenever a
person sneezed.<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>

<p>The Portuguese traveler, Godinho, wrote that whenever
the emperor of Monomotapa sneezed, acclamations
were universal throughout his realm; and in Guinea in
the last century, whenever a person of rank sneezed,
every one present knelt down, clapped their hands, and
wished him every blessing. The courtiers of the king
of Sennaar in Nubia are wont on the occasion of a
royal sneeze to turn their backs on their sovereign
while vigorously slapping the right hip.<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> Among the
Zulu tribes, sneezing is viewed as a favorable symptom
in a sick person, and the natives are accustomed
to return thanks after it. In Madagascar, when a
child sneezes, its mother invokes the divine blessing,
conformably to European usage; and in Persia the
sneezer is the recipient of congratulations and good
wishes.</p>

<p>In the “Zend-Avesta,” or sacred writings of the
Persian religion, is the injunction: “And whensoever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
it be that thou hearest a sneeze given by thy neighbor,
thou shalt say unto him, <i>Ahunavar Ashim-Vuhu</i>, and
so shall it be well with thee.”<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> In Egypt, if a man
sneeze, he says, “Praise be to God!” and all present,
with the exception of servants, rejoin, “God have
mercy upon you!”<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p>The Omahas, Dakotas, and other Sioux tribes of
American Indians attach a peculiar importance to
sneezing. Thus, if one of their number sneeze once,
he believes that his name has been called either by
his son, his wife, or some intimate friend. Hence he
at once exclaims, “My son!” But if he sneeze twice,
he says, “My son and his mother!”<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p>In France the rules of etiquette formerly required
that a gentleman who sneezed in the presence of
another should take off his hat, and on the subsidence
of the paroxysm he was expected formally to return
the salutes of all present. The salutation of sneezers
by removal of the hat was customary in England also.
Joseph Hall, who was Bishop of Exeter in 1627, wrote
that when a superstitious man sneezed he did not
reckon among his friends those present who failed to
uncover.</p>

<p>The Italians are wont to salute the sneezer with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
ejaculation <i lang="it">Viva</i>, or <i lang="it">Felicità</i>; and it has been reasoned
that the latter expression may have been sometimes
employed under like circumstances by the ancient
Romans, because an advertisement on the walls of
Pompeii concludes by wishing the people Godspeed
with the single word <i lang="la">Felicitas</i>!</p>

<p>So, too, in Ireland the sneezer is greeted with fervent
benedictions, such as, “The blessing of God and the
holy Mary be upon you!” for such invocations are
thought to counteract the machinations of evil-disposed
fairies.<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p>The Siamese have a unique theory of their own on
this subject. They believe that the Supreme Judge of
the spiritual world is continually turning over the pages
of a book containing an account of the life and doings
of every human being; and when he comes to the
page relating to any individual, the latter never fails to
sneeze. In this way the Siamese endeavor to give a
plausible reason for the prevalence of sneezing among
men, and also for the accompanying salutation. In
Siam and Laos the ordinary expression is, “May the
judgment be favorable to you.”<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

<p>In the Netherlands a person who sneezes is believed
thereby to place himself in the power of a witch, unless
some one invokes a divine blessing; and such notions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
afford a plausible explanation of one theory of the
origin of this custom.<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>

<p>Grimm (vol. iv. p. 1637) refers to a passage in the
“Avadanas,” or Buddhist parables, in which the rat is
represented as wishing the cat joy when she sneezes.
And in the department of Finistère in northwest
France, when a horse sneezes or coughs the people
say, “May St. Eloy assist you!” St. Eloy was the
guardian of farriers and the tutelar god of horses.<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>

<p>The natives of the Fiji Islands exclaim after a
sneeze, “<i>Mbula</i>,” that is, “May you live!” or “Health
to you!” And the sneezer politely responds with
“<i>Mole</i>,” “Thanks.” Formerly Fijian etiquette was
yet more exacting and required the sneezer to add,
“May you club some one!” or “May your wife have
twins!”<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></p>

<p>A Spanish writer, Juan Cervera Bachiller, in his book
“Creencias y superstitiones,” Madrid, 1883, says that
this widely diffused practice appears to have originated
partly from religious motives and partly from gallantry,
and that it is as obviously a relic of pagan times as
are the various omens which have ever been associated
with sneezing.</p>

<p>The apparently independent origin of the custom of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
salutation after sneezing among nations remote from
each other, and its prevalence from time immemorial
alike in the most cultured communities and among
uncivilized races, have been thought to furnish striking
evidence of the essential similarity of human minds,
whatever their environment.</p>

<h3>VI. LEGENDS RELATING TO SNEEZING</h3>

<p>In the traditional lore of ancient Picardy is the following
legend:—</p>

<p>In the vicinity of Englebelmer nocturnal wayfarers
were often surprised at hearing repeated sneezes by the
roadside, and the young people of the neighboring villages
made frequent attempts to ascertain the origin of
the mysterious sounds, but without avail. The mischievous
spirit or <i>lutin</i> took pleasure in seeing them
run about in a vain search while he himself remained
invisible. Finally people became accustomed to hearing
these phantom sneezes, and, as no harm had ever
resulted to any one, with the contempt bred of familiarity
they gave little heed to the spiritual manifestations,
and were content with merely crossing themselves devoutly.</p>

<p>One fine moonlight evening in summer a peasant
returning from market heard the usual <i>Atchi, atchi</i>,
but pursued his way with equanimity. However, the
<i>lutin</i> pursued him for about a mile, sneezing repeatedly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
At length the peasant impatiently exclaimed,
“May the good Lord bless you and your cold in the
head!” Scarcely had he spoken when there appeared
before him the apparition of a man clad in a long
white garment. “Thank you, my friend,” said he:
“you have just released me from the spell under which
I have long rested. In consequence of my sins, God
condemned me to wander about this village sneezing
without rest from eve till morn, until some charitable
person should deliver me by saying a benediction.
For at least five hundred years I have thus roamed
about, and you are the first one who has said to me
‘God bless you.’ Fortunately it occurred to me to
follow you, and thus I have been set free. I thank
you. Good-by.”</p>

<p>Thereafter the mysterious sounds were no longer
heard; and thus, in the belief of the peasants of Picardy,
arose the custom of salutation after sneezing.<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p>

<p>Under a bridge near the town of Paderborn, in
Prussia, there lives a poor soul who does nothing but
sneeze at frequent intervals. If a wagon happens to
pass over the bridge at the moment when a sneeze is
heard, and the driver fails to say “God help thee,” the
vehicle will surely be overturned, and the driver will
become poor and break his leg.</p>

<p>Tradition says that a godless fellow who died long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
ago of incessant sneezing, during an epidemic of the
plague at Wurmlingen in Würtemberg, was condemned
on account of his sins to wander about the neighborhood,
still sneezing at intervals. One day, while one
of the villagers was crossing a bridge over some meadows
near the town, he heard some one underneath
sneeze twice, and each time he piously responded, “God
help thee!” When, however, he heard a third sneeze,
the villager thought to himself, “That fellow may keep
on sneezing for a long time and make a fool of me.”
So he cried out angrily, “May the Devil help you!”
Thereupon a voice from under the bridge exclaimed
pitifully, “If you had only said, ‘God help thee!’ a
third time, I should have been freed from the spell
which binds me.”<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<h3>I. EGYPTIAN DAYS</h3>

<p>The belief in lucky and unlucky days appears to
have been first taught by the magicians of ancient
Chaldea, and we learn from history that similar notions
affected every detail of primitive Babylonian life, thousands
of years before Christ. Reference to an “unlucky
month” is to be found in a list of deprecatory
incantations contained in a document from the library
of the royal palace at Nineveh. This document is
written in the Accadian dialect of the Turanian language,
which was akin to that spoken in the region
of the lower Euphrates; a language already obsolete
and unintelligible to the Assyrians of the seventh century
<span class="smcapuc">B. C.</span><a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> Certain days were called <i lang="la">Dies Egyptiaci</i>,
because they were thought to have been pronounced
unlucky by the astrologers of ancient Egypt.</p>

<p>In that country the unlucky days were, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
fewer in number than the fortunate ones, and they also
differed in the degree of their ill-luck. Thus, while
some were markedly ominous, others merely threatened
misfortune, and still others were of mixed augury,
partly good and partly evil. There were certain days
upon which absolute idleness was enjoined upon the
people, when they were expected to sit quietly at home,
indulging in <i lang="it">dolce far niente</i>.<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></p>

<p>The poet Hesiod, who is believed to have flourished
about one thousand years <span class="smcapuc">B. C.</span>, in the third book of
his poem, “Works and Days,” which is indeed a kind
of metrical almanac, distinguishes lucky days from
others, and gives advice to farmers regarding the most
favorable days for the various operations of agriculture.
Thus he recommends the eleventh of the month as
excellent for reaping corn, and the twelfth for shearing
sheep. But the thirteenth was an unlucky day for
sowing, though favorable for planting. The fifth of
each month was an especially unfortunate day, while
the thirtieth was the most propitious of all.</p>

<p>Some of the most intelligent and learned Greeks
were very punctilious in their observance of Egyptian
days. The philosopher Proclus (<span class="smcapuc">A. D.</span> 412-485) was
said to be even more scrupulous in this regard than the
Egyptians themselves. And Plotinus (<span class="smcapuc">A. D.</span> 204-270),
another eminent Grecian philosopher, believed with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
astrologers of a later day, that the positions of the
planets in the heavens exerted an influence over human
affairs.<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p>In an ancient calendar of the year 334, in the reign
of Constantine the Great, twenty-six Egyptian days
were designated.<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> At an early period, however, the
church authorities forbade the superstitious observance
of these days.</p>

<p>Some of the most eminent early writers of the Christian
Church, St. Ambrose, St. Augustine, and St. Chrysostom,
were earnest in their denunciation of the prevalent
custom of regulating the affairs of life by reference
to the supposed omens of the calendar. The fourth
council of Carthage, in 398, censured such practices;
and the synod of Rouen, in the reign of Clovis,
anathematized those who placed faith in such relics of
paganism.<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<p>We learn on the authority of Marco Polo that the
Brahmins of the province of Laristan, in southern
Persia, in the thirteenth century, were extremely punctilious
in their choice of suitable days for the performance
of any business matters. This famous traveler
wrote that a Brahmin who contemplated making a
purchase, for example, would measure the length of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
own shadow in the early morning sunlight, and if the
shadow were of the proper length, as officially prescribed
for that day, he would proceed to make the
purchase; otherwise he would wait until the shadow
conformed in length to a predetermined standard for
that day of the week.</p>

<p>The Latin historian, Rolandino (1200-76), in the
third book of his “Chronicle,” describes an undertaking
which resulted disastrously because, as was alleged,
it was rashly begun on an “Egyptian day.” There is
frequent mention of these days in many ancient manuscripts
in the Ambrosian Library at Milan.<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>

<p>In a so-called “Book of Precedents,” printed in
1616, fifty-three days are specified as being “such as
the Egyptians noted to be dangerous to begin or take
anything in hand, or to take a journey or any such
thing.” An ancient manuscript mentions twenty-eight
days in the year “which were revealed by the Angel
Gabriel to good Joseph, which ever have been remarked
to be very fortunayte dayes either to let blood,
cure wounds, use marchandizes, sow seed, build houses,
or take journees.”</p>

<p>Astrologers formerly specified particular days when
it was dangerous for physicians to bleed patients; and
especially to be avoided were the first Monday in April,
on which day Cain was born and his brother Abel slain;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
the first Monday in August, the alleged anniversary of
the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah; and the last
Monday in December, which was the reputed birthday
of Judas Iscariot.</p>

<p>In Mason’s “Anatomie of Sorcerie” (1612), the
prevailing notions on this subject were characterized
as vain speculations of the astrologers, having neither
foundation in God’s word nor yet natural reason to
support them, but being grounded only upon the superstitious
imagination of men. A work of 1620, entitled
“Melton’s Astrologaster,” says that the Christian faith
is violated when, like a pagan and apostate, any man
“doth observe those days which are called <i lang="la">Egyptiaci</i>,
or the calends of January, or any month, day, time,
or year, either to travel, marry or do anything in.”
And the learned Sir Thomas Browne, in his “Pseudodoxia
Epidemica,” published in 1658, declaimed in
quaint but forcible language against the frivolity of
such doctrines.</p>

<h3>II. ROMAN SUPERSTITION CONCERNING DAYS</h3>

<p>The Romans had their <i lang="la">dies fasti</i>, corresponding to
the modern court days in England. On such days, of
which there were thirty-eight in the year, it was lawful
for the prætor to administer justice and to pronounce
the three words, <i lang="la">Do, dico, addico</i>, “I give laws, declare
right, and adjudge losses.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>The days on which the courts were not held were
called <i lang="la">nefasti</i> (from <i lang="la">ne</i> and <i lang="la">fari</i>), because the three
words could not then be legally spoken by the prætor.
But these days came to be regarded as unlucky, a fact
rendered evident by an expression of Horace. The
Romans also classed as unfortunate the days immediately
following the calends, nones, and ides of each
month. Unlucky days were termed <i lang="la">dies atri</i>, because
they were marked in the calendar with black charcoal,
the lucky ones being indicated by means of white
chalk. There were also days which were thought
especially favorable for martial operations, but the anniversary
of a national misfortune was considered very
inauspicious. Thus after the defeat of the Romans by
the Gauls under Brennus on the banks of the river
Allia, July 16, 390 <span class="smcapuc">B. C.</span>, that date was given a prominent
place among the black days of the calendar.
But not every general was influenced by such superstitions.
Lucullus, when an attempt was made to dissuade
him from attacking Tigranes, king of Armenia
(whom he defeated <span class="smcapuc">B. C.</span> 69), because upon that date
the Cimbri had vanquished a Roman army, replied,
“<em>I</em> will make it a day of <em>good</em> omen for the Romans.”<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>
The Roman ladies, we are told, gave less heed to the
unlucky days of their own calendar than to the works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
of Egyptian astrologers, among whom Petosiris was
their favorite authority, when they wished to ascertain
the proper day, and even the hour, for the performance
of household and other duties.<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></p>

<p>Horace (book ii. ode xiii.) thus apostrophizes a tree,
by whose fall he narrowly escaped being crushed at
Sabinum: “Thou cursed tree! whoever he was that
first planted thee did it surely on an unlucky day, and
with a sacrilegious hand.”</p>

<p>The Latin writer, Macrobius, stated that when one of
the <i lang="la">nundinæ</i> or market days fell upon New Year’s, it
was considered very unfortunate. In such an event the
Emperor Augustus, who was very superstitious, adopted
the method of inserting an extra day in the previous
year and subtracting one from that ensuing, thus preserving
the regularity of the Julian style of reckoning
time. Ordinarily, however, New Year’s Day was deemed
auspicious, and on that day, as now, people were accustomed
to wish each other happiness and good fortune.</p>

<h3>III. MEDIÆVAL BELIEF IN DAY-FATALITY</h3>

<p>The early Saxons in England were extremely credulous
in regard to the luck or misfortune of particular
days of the month, and derived a legion of prognostics,
both good and evil, from the age of the moon. Thus,
they considered the twelfth day of the lunar month a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
profitable one for sowing, getting married, traveling,
and blood-letting, but the thirteenth day was in bad
repute among the Saxons, an evil day for undertaking
any work. The fourteenth was good for all purposes,
for buying serfs, marrying, and putting children to
school; whereas the sixteenth was profitable for nothing
but thieving. The twenty-second was a proper time for
buying villains, or agricultural bondmen, and a boy
born on that day would become a physician. The
twenty-fifth was good for hunting, and a girl then born
would be of a greedy disposition and a “wool-teaser.”<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p>

<p>In an English manuscript of the twelfth century
mentioned in Chambers’s “Book of Days,” and known
as the “Exeter Calendar,” New Year’s is set down as a
<i lang="la">Dies mala</i>. As an illustration of the credulity prevalent
in England in the fifteenth century regarding
the influences, meteorological and moral, of the occurrence
of important church festivals on particular days
of the week, a few lines from a manuscript of the
Harleian Collection in the British Museum are here
quoted:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Lordlings all of you I warn,</div>
<div class="verse">If the day that Christ was born</div>
<div class="verse">Fell upon a Sunday,</div>
<div class="verse">The winter shall be good, I say,</div>
<div class="verse">But great winds aloft shall be;</div>
<div class="verse">The summer shall be fair and dry,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
<div class="verse">By kind skill and without loss.</div>
<div class="verse">Through all lands there shall be peace.</div>
<div class="verse">Good time for all things to be done,</div>

<div class="verse">What child that day born may be</div>
<div class="verse">A great lord he shall live to be.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Not alone in Britain, but throughout the world,
men have esteemed one day above another. This universal
tendency of the human mind is tersely expressed
in a translation by Barnaby Googe of some verses
accredited to the Bavarian theologian, Thomas Kirchmaier
(1511-78), whose literary pseudonym was Naogeorgus:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">For all be not of vertue like, nor like preheminence,</div>
<div class="verse">But some of them Egyptian are and full of jeopardee,</div>
<div class="verse">And some againe, beside the rest, both good and luckie bee,</div>
<div class="verse">Like difference of the nights they make, as if the Almightie King,</div>
<div class="verse">That made them all, not gracious were to them in everything.<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>John Gaule, in his “Magastromancer” (1652), remarks
that, according to the teachings of the astrologers,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Times can give a certain fortune to our business. The
magicians likewise have observed, and all the antient verse
men consent in this, that it is of very great concernment in
what moment of time and disposition of the heavens everything,
whether naturall or artificial, hath received its being
in this world: for they have delivered that the first moment
hath so great power that all the course of fortune dependeth
thereon and may be foretold thereby.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>In the dark ages, and also in early modern times, the
false doctrines of astrology, an inheritance from the
ancients, dominated the actions of men. In all important
enterprises, as well as in every-day labors, it was
deemed essential to make a beginning under the influence
of a favorable planet. Nor did these beliefs prevail
exclusively among ignorant people, but were as
well a part of the creed of scholars, and of the nobility
and gentry. Modern astronomical discoveries, and
especially the Copernican system, availed to banish a
vast amount of superstition regarding the malevolent
character of certain days. But neither science nor
religion have yet been able wholly to eradicate it, as is
evident from the ill-repute associated with the sixth day
of the week even at the present time, a subject to be
considered later.</p>

<p>In the “Loseley Manuscripts,” edited by Alfred John
Kempe, London, 1836, is to be found a letter, some
extracts from which may serve to illustrate the paramount
influence of astrology in England in the sixteenth
century. The letter is addressed to Mr. George
More, at Thorpe:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The influence of the position of the moon in determining
the proper seasons for surgical operations, and
for the administration of medicines, may be best illustrated
by a few extracts from ancient almanacs.</p>

<p>An antique illustrated manuscript almanac for the
year 1386 contains the following advice to physicians:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In a new mone sal not be layting of blode, for yan are
mennys bodyes voyed of blode and humos, and yan by layting
of blode sal yay more be anoyded.</p>

</div>

<p>And again:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It es to know generally, yt ye tyme electe to gyve a medcyn
in es whan ye mone and ye Lord ascendyng ar free from all
ille and not let by it, … and it es hyely to be ware to a
medcyn whyles ye mone es in an ill aspect, wt Satne or
Mars.</p>

</div>

<p>An almanac for the year 1568, published by John
Securis, London, contains a list of days in that year
favorable or otherwise for the preservation of man’s
health.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>The second day of January was therein declared to
be wholly propitious. The twelfth was unfavorable,
owing to the furious aspect of Mars to the Sun, which
was not, however, likely to cause bodily sickness, but
rather to incline the hearts of some people to imagine
evil of their rulers. The fifteenth of April was especially
to be dreaded. On that day, says the writer,
“God keep us from the fury of Mars.”</p>

<p>In June evil passions were to stir men’s hearts,
anger, hatred, and strife; for in that month were no
less than six quartile aspects of the planets, one to
another.</p>

<p>Many propitious days are also mentioned, and in
conclusion <em>all</em> days are declared to be favorable to a
good man.</p>

<p>“A New Almanacke and Prognostication for the
Yeare of our Lord God 1569” (London) says that surgical
operations must be performed only when “the
Moone or Lorde of the firste house” is in the zodiacal
sign governing the particular member or organ which
is to be operated upon.</p>

<p>And in an English almanac for the year 1571 we find
the following passage:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>No part of man’s body ought to be touched with the
Chirurgicall instruments, or cauterie actuall or potencial,
when the Sunne or Moone, or the Lord of the Ascendent, is
in the same signe that ruleth that part of man’s body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>Also <em>Gemini</em>, <em>Leo</em>, the last halfe of <em>Libra</em>, and the first
12 degrees of <em>Scorpio</em>: with <em>Taurus</em>, <em>Virgo</em>, and <em>Capricorne</em>,
are not good for the letting of bloud. Two days
before the change of the Moone, and a day after, is yll to
let bloud.…</p>

<p>If the same be for the Pestilence, the Phrensie, the Pluresie,
the Squincie, or for a Continuall headach, proceeding of
choler or bloud; or for any burning Ague, or extreme paine
of partes, a man may not so carefully stay for a chosen day
by the <cite>Almanack</cite>: for that in the meane tyme the pacient
perhaps may dye. For which cause let the skilfull Chirurgeon
open a veine, unless he finde the pacient verie weake, or
that the Moone be in the Same Syne that governeth that part
of man’s body.</p>

</div>

<p>The persistence of similar beliefs is shown by the following
extract from “A Briefe Prognosticon or rather
Diagnosticon for this Year of Grace” (1615), by John
Keene, London:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Seeing that these inferiour and sublunary mixt bodies
are governed of the superiour and simple bodies, and especially
by the motion of our neighbour Planet, the Moone,
diseases vary and differ, and not for that she exceedes the
rest in vertue and power, but because she is neerer us and
swifter in motion; for wee see, the Moone increasing, humours
increase; and when she decreaseth, humours decrease: for the
bones in the full of the Moone are full of marrow, all living
creatures both on sea and land, are then augmented in humiditie,
as the Crab, Lobster, Oyster, etc. Also humours in
man’s bodie and in Plants are then increased: for when the
Sunne and Moone are in hot signes, heate is increased, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
cold signes, cold exceedes heate; therefore have we just cause
in purging of humours to consider the motion of the Moone
through every signe of the Zodiacke, not only in purging of
humours, but also in curing diseases and in strengthening
the faculties and vertues.</p>

</div>

<p>In the “Dialogue of Dives and Pauper,” printed
by Richard Pynson in 1493, this subject is referred to
as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Alle that take hede to dysmal dayes, or use nyce observances
in the newe moone, or in the newe yeere, as setting of
mete or drynke by night on the benche to fede alholde (or
gobelyn).</p>

</div>

<p>The French traveler, Jean Chardin (1643-1713),
stated that in the year 1668 Cossacks invaded the
northern provinces of Persia; and when the inhabitants
appealed to the Persian government for aid, they
received only the reply that no assistance could be sent
them until the moon had passed out of the sign of the
Scorpion. The Persians formerly divided all the days
of the year into three classes,—preferable or lucky, middling
or indifferent, and unlucky or detested ones;<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> and
the Emperor Frederick the Great of Prussia (1712-86)
was governed in his military operations by the
advice of astrologers, and always waited until they had
indicated the fortunate moment for a start.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>The “English Apollo, by Richard Saunders, student
in the divine, laudable, and celestial sciences, London,
1656,” in giving advice to mariners, says that the good
or bad position of the planets at the time of sailing
has much influence over the fortunes of a voyage.
The ancient sages, moreover, declared that the chief
means of averting evil were, first, the devout invocation
of Providence; and, secondly, the careful choice
of a proper time for sailing by observation of the rules
of astrology.</p>

<p>In William Jones’s “Credulities Past and Present”
(1525), St. Augustine is quoted as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>No man shall observe by the days on what day he
travel, or on what he return; because God created all the
seven days which run in the week to the end of this world.
But whithersoever he desires to go, let him sing and say his
<cite>Paternoster</cite>, if he know it, and call upon his Lord, and bless
himself, and travel free from care, under the protection of
God, without the sorceries of the Devil.</p>

</div>

<h3>IV. PREVALENCE OF SIMILAR BELIEFS IN MODERN
TIMES</h3>

<p>Among the Chinese of to-day, as with the inhabitants
of ancient Babylon, the days which are deemed
favorable or otherwise for business transactions, farming
operations, or for traveling are still determined by
astrologers, and are indicated in an official almanac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
published annually at Pekin by the Imperial Board of
Astronomers. The various tribes of the island of Madagascar
also are exceedingly superstitious in regard to
the luck or ill-luck attending certain days, and the lives
of children born at an unlucky time are sometimes
sacrificed to save them from anticipated misfortune.</p>

<p>Natives of the Gold Coast of West Africa, in their
divisions of the year, observe a “long time” consisting
of nineteen lucky days, and a “short time” of seven
equally propitious days. The seven days intervening
between these two periods are considered unlucky, and
during this time they undertake no voyages nor warlike
enterprises. Somewhat similar ideas prevail in Java
and Sumatra, and in many of the smaller islands of the
Malay Archipelago. The Cossacks of western Siberia,
the natives of the Baltic provinces of the Russian Empire,
and the Laplanders of the far North, all adapt
their lives to the black and white days of their calendar.
The peasantry of West Sussex in England will not permit
their children to go blackberrying on the tenth day
of October, on account of a belief that the Devil goes
afield on that day, and bad luck would surely befall
any one rash enough to eat fruit gathered under such
circumstances. The same people believe that all cats
born in the month of May are hypochondriacs, and have
an unpleasant habit of bringing snakes and vipers into
the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the Moslems of India there are in each month
seven evil days, on which no enterprise is to be undertaken
on any consideration. Some of the peculiar
superstitions of these people with regard to traveling
on the different week-days are shown in “Zanoon-E-Islam,
or the Customs of the Mussulmans of India,” by
Jaffur Shurreef. Thus, if any one proposes journeying
on Saturday, he should eat fish before starting, in order
that his plan may be successfully accomplished, but
on Sunday betel-leaf is preferable for this purpose. In
like manner, on Monday he should look into a mirror
in order to obtain wealth. On Tuesday he should eat
coriander-seed, and on Wednesday should partake of
curdled milk before starting. On Thursday, if he eat
raw sugar, he may confidently anticipate returning with
plenty of merchandise; and on Friday, if he eat dressed
meat, he will bring back pearls and jewels galore.</p>

<p>Some idea of the beliefs current in the mother country
during the last century may be obtained by a study
of the advertisements of astrologers and medical charlatans
in the public press of that period. For example,
in the year 1773 one Sylvester Partridge, proprietor
and vendor of antidotes, elixirs, washes for freckles,
plumpers for rounding the cheeks, glass eyes, calves
and noses, ivory jaws, and a new receipt for changing
the color of the hair, offered for a consideration to
furnish advice as to the proper times and seasons for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
letting blood, and to indicate the most favorable aspect
of the moon for drawing teeth and cutting corns. He
proffered counsel, moreover, as to the avoidance of
unlucky days for paring the nails, and the kindest
zodiacal sign for grafting, inoculation, and opening of
bee-hives.</p>

<p>In enlightened England there are still to be found
many people who believe that the relative positions of
the sun, moon, and planets are prime factors in determining
the proper times and seasons for undertaking
terrestrial enterprises. Zadkiel’s Almanac for 1898
states that natural astrology is making good progress
towards becoming once more a recognized science. To
quote from the preface of this publication:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>As the whole body of the ocean is not able to keep down
one single particle of free air, which must assuredly force its
way to the surface to unite with the atmosphere, so cannot
the combined forces of the prejudice and studied contempt of
all the <i lang="fr">soi-disant</i> “really scientific men” of the end of the
century prevent the truth of <i lang="la">astrologia sana</i> from soaring
above their futile efforts to crush it down, to join the great
atmosphere of natural science, to enlighten the human mind
in its onward course and effort,—“to soar through Nature
up to Nature’s God.”</p>

</div>

<p>One example may suffice to exhibit the character of
the predictions given in this same work. Under the caption,
“Voice of the Stars,” August, 1898, the writer says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
that the stationary positions of Saturn and Uranus are
likely to shake Spain (and perhaps Tuscany) physically
and politically about the 10th or 11th insts. There
will be strained diplomatic relations between the United
States and Spain; for Mars in the sign Gemini, and
Saturn in Sagittarius, must create friction and disturbances
in both countries.</p>

<p>The Jewish current beliefs in the influence of certain
days and seasons appear to have been mostly derived
from the Romans of old. Even nowadays among the
Jews no marriages are solemnized during the interval
of fifty days between the Feast of the Passover and
Pentecost; and formerly the favorite wedding-days
were those of the new or full moon.<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> In Siam the
eighth and fifteenth days of the moon are observed as
sacred, and devoted to worship and rest from ordinary
labor. Sportsmen are forbidden to hunt or fish on
these days. The Siamese astrologers indicate the probable
character of any year by associating it with some
animal, upon whose back the New Year is represented
as being mounted.<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<h3>V. THE SIXTH DAY OF THE WEEK</h3>

<p>Let us now consider the subject of Friday as an alleged
<i lang="la">dies mala</i>. The seven week-days were originally
named after Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Mercury,
Venus, and the Moon, in the order given, and these
names are found in the early Christian calendars. The
Teutonic nations, however, adopted corresponding names
in the Northern mythology,—the Sun and Moon, Tyr,
the Norse God of War, Wodan, Thor, Freyja, and Saturn;
and our early Saxon ancestors worshiped images representing
all these deities until Christianity supplanted
paganism in Britain. It has been suggested that our
Friday may have been named after Frigga, the wife of
Odin and the principal goddess of the ancient Scandinavians.
But it is much more probable that the day
derives its name from Freyja, the Goddess of Love, a
deity corresponding to the Roman Venus and the Grecian
Aphrodite. Freyja, the most easily propitiated of
the goddesses, was wont to listen favorably to all who
invoked her aid, and was especially tender-hearted to
disconsolate lovers. She dwelt in a magnificent palace,
and journeyed about in a car drawn by two cats.<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p>It has been hinted that Freyja’s character was not
irreproachable, and that thence arose Friday’s ill-repute,
but such an hypothesis is wholly untenable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>From the prose “Edda” we learn that this goddess
was the wife of one Odur, and had a daughter named
Hnossa, who was wonderfully beautiful. Sad to relate,
Freyja was abandoned by her husband, who went away
to visit foreign lands, and she has since spent much time
in weeping, her tears being turned into drops of pure
gold.<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<p>The fish was an emblem of Freyja, and as such was
offered by the Scandinavians to their goddess on the
sixth day of the week.<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> The fish was also held sacred
by the Babylonians and Assyrians, and by the ancient
Romans as a symbol of Venus.</p>

<p>The generally accepted theory is that the crucifixion
of our Lord on Good Friday was the origin of the
widespread superstitions regarding the sixth day of
the week. It is highly probable, however, that these
beliefs originated at a much earlier epoch; for similar
ideas are current among the inhabitants of heathen
countries, as in Hindostan, for example. According to
an ancient monkish legend, Adam and Eve partook of
the forbidden fruit on a Friday; and in the Middle
Ages many inauspicious occurrences of history or tradition
were thought to have happened on that day.</p>

<p>In a French manuscript of the year 1285, preserved
in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, entitled “Recommandation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
du Vendredi,” the following events are
alleged to have occurred on a Friday: Adam’s creation,
his sin and expulsion from Eden, the murder of Abel,
Christ’s crucifixion, the stoning of Stephen, the massacre
of the Innocents by Herod, the crucifixion of Peter,
the beheading of Paul and that of John the Baptist,
and the flight of the children of Israel through the
Red Sea; also the Deluge, the Confusion of Tongues
at the Tower of Babel, and the infliction of the Plagues
upon the land of Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p>The following extract from a translation of a Saxon
manuscript of about the year 1120 may serve to illustrate
the credulity of that epoch in England, and the
odium attaching to Friday:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Whoever is born on Sunday or its night, shall live without
anxiety and be handsome. If he is born on Monday or
its night, he shall be killed of men, be he laic or be he cleric.
If on Tuesday or its night, he shall be corrupt in his life, and
sinful and perverse. If he be born on Wednesday or its
night, he shall be very peaceable and easy and shall grow up
well and be a lover of good.… If he be born on Friday
or its night, he shall be accursed of men, silly and crafty and
loathsome to all men and shall ever be thinking evil in his
heart, and shall be a thief and a great coward, and shall not
live longer than to mid-age. If he is born on Saturday or its
night, his deeds shall be renowned, he shall be an alderman,
whether he be man or woman; many things shall happen
unto him, and he shall live long.<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>Although the superstitions of the dark ages may
seem to us so childish, it may yet be affirmed with
reason that, in proportion to the enlightenment of the
times, the beliefs then current regarding day-fatality
were no more absurd than those of our own era. In
the “Reliques of Ancient English Poetry,” by Thomas
Percy, D. D., is to be found the following “excellent
way to get a fayrie:”—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>First, get a broad square christall or Venice glasse, in
length and breadth three inches. Then lay that glasse or
christall in the blood of a white hen, three Wednesdayes or
three Fridayes. Then take it out and wash it with holy aq;
and fumigate it. Then take three hazle sticks or wands of an
yeare groth; pill them fayre and white; and make them so
longe as you write the spiritt’s name, or fayrie’s name, which
you call three times on every stick being made flatt on one
side. Then bury them under some hill, whereat you suppose
fayries haunt, the Wednesday before you call her; and the
Fridaye followinge take them uppe and at eight, or three or
ten of the clocke which be good planetts and houres for that
turne; but when you call be in cleane life and turn thy face
towards the east, and when you have her bind her in that
stone and glasse.<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Whiston, the translator of Josephus, publicly proclaimed
in London that the comet of 1712 would be
visible on October 14 of that year, and that on the
Friday morning ensuing the world would be destroyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
by fire. In the resulting panic, many people embarked
in boats on the Thames, believing the water to be the
safer element, on that particular Friday at least.</p>

<p>Mr. Charles Godfrey Leland, in his “Etruscan Roman
Remains,” says that in certain mediæval manuscripts
the Goddess Venus was represented as the Queen of
Hearts and a dealer of lucky cards. Therefore Friday,
the <i lang="la">Dies Veneris</i>, was sometimes considered a lucky
day, especially for matrimony. This opinion finds
favor in Glasgow, where a large proportion of marriages
take place on this day; whereas, in the midland counties
of England, less than two per cent. of the weddings
occur on the sixth day of the week.<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>

<p>References to the popular sentiment regarding Friday
are frequent in the works of English writers. Sir
Thomas Overbury, in his description of “a faire and
happy Milk-mayd,” says: “Her dreams are so chaste
that shee dare tell them; only a Fridaie’s dream is all
her superstition: that she conceales for feare of anger.”
Again, in the play of “Sir John Oldcastle” is this
passage: “Friday, quotha, a dismal day, Candlemas
Day this year was Friday.”<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> And in Scott’s “Marmion”
is the following:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The Highlander, whose red claymore</div>
<div class="verse">The battle turned on Maldas’ shore,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Will on a Friday morn look pale</div>
<div class="verse">If asked to tell a fairy tale.</div>
<div class="verse">He fears the vengeful Elfin King,</div>
<div class="verse">Who leaves that day his grassy ring;</div>
<div class="verse">Invisible to human ken,</div>
<div class="verse">He walks among the sons of men.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As a refreshing instance of independence of thought
in a credulous age, we may quote from a letter written
by Sir Winston Churchill, father of the Duke of Marlborough,
and printed in a tract of 1687. The letter,
though ungrammatical, is given verbatim:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I have made great experience of the truth of it, and have
set down Friday as my own lucky day, the day on which I was
born, christened, married, and which, I believe, will be the
day of my death. The day on which I have had sundry
deliverances from perils by sea and land, perils by false
brethren, perils of law-suits, etc. I was knighted (by chance
unexpected of myself) on the same day and have several good
accidents happened to me on that day; and am so superstitious
in the belief of its good omen, that I choose to begin
any considerable action that concerns me, on the same day.<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

</div>

<h3>VI. FRIDAY IN MODERN TIMES</h3>

<p>Friday is the Sabbath of the Moslems, corresponding
to the Sunday of the Christians and the Saturday of
the Jews. In Egypt Friday is therefore blessed above
all other days, while Saturday is the most unfortunate.</p>

<p>However, although Friday was the day selected by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Mahomet for the holding of the Moslem Assembly, it
was not wholly devoted to religious worship, and at the
conclusion of public prayers business was transacted
as on any other week-day.<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> Among Mohammedans
Friday is considered the most lucky of days; and it
is also the most popular for commencing any enterprise
of importance, whether building a house, planting a
garden, embarking on a voyage, contracting a marriage,
or making a garment.<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

<p>One reason for Mahomet’s choice of Friday as the
day for public prayers was probably because this day
was consecrated by the people of many nations to Alilat,
the celestial Venus or Urania, whom the ancient
Arabs worshiped.<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> Mahomet said that whoever bathed
on Friday and walked to the public religious service,
taking a seat near the <i>Imam</i> or <i>Khalifah</i> (the leader
of a Moslem tribe), and listened attentively to the
sermon, avoiding meanwhile frivolous conversation,
would obtain the reward of a whole year’s prayers
at night for every step which he took between his
home and the place of this assembly.<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></p>

<p>The Moslems among the peasants inhabiting the
frontier region between Afghanistan and Hindostan
have a special reverence for Friday; for they believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
that on that day God rested, after having created the
world. On Friday eve, according to their belief, the
spirits of the departed are wont to revisit their former
abodes, and hence the custom prevails of sending delicacies
to the mosque at such times.<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

<p>Friday was the most popular day for weddings among
the Jews in mediæval times, and its selection appears to
have been due to expediency, because of its nearness to
the Jewish Sabbath, and the convenience of associating
the marriage ceremony with the services in the synagogue
on the latter day. The bridal pair fasted on the
morning of the wedding, and ashes were sprinkled over
their heads during the ceremony.<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></p>

<p>According to the teachings of the Talmud, a second
soul was believed to enter men’s bodies every Friday
evening and to remain throughout the following day,
its presence being indicated by an increased appetite
for food.<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>

<p>On Friday, says an old tradition, is held the Witches’
Sabbath or Assembly, and one should be careful not to
speak of these creatures on that day, for their hearing
is then especially acute, and disrespectful remarks will
render one liable to incur their spite.</p>

<p>In the popular belief of the Swabians, Friday is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
day when the witches celebrate their joint festival
with the Devil on the Heuberg, near Rotenburg,
and afterward scour the country, intent on working
all manner of mischief upon the people and their
cattle.<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></p>

<p>According to a Scotch superstition, however, witches
were supposed to hold their weekly meetings on Saturdays,
in unfrequented places. The formal proceedings
on these occasions included an address by the Devil,
and the holding of a court, wherein each witch was
expected to give a detailed statement of her doings;
and those who had been idle were given a beating with
their own broomsticks, the diligent being rewarded by
gifts of enchanted bones. A dance followed, the Devil
playing on the bag-pipes, and leading the music.<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<p>The Irish are careful not to mention fairies by name
either on Wednesdays or Fridays, for these invisible
creatures are unusually alert on these two days.</p>

<p>On Fridays especially, their power for evil is very
strong. On that day, therefore, a careful watch is kept
over the children and cattle; a lighted wisp of straw is
waved about the baby’s head, and a quenched coal is
placed under the cradle and churn. And if the horses
are more than usually restive in their stalls, it is a sure
sign that the fairies are riding them; therefore the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
people spit three times at the animals, and the fairies
thereupon immediately take their departure.<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></p>

<p>In Ireland Friday is <i lang="la">facile princeps</i> among unlucky
days, and especial care should be taken not to open
the door of one’s dwelling to any stranger on that
day. Neither butter nor milk should be given away,
nor should a cat be taken from one house to another on
a Friday. To undo a sorcerer’s spell, one should eat
barley cakes over which an incantation has been said;
but the cakes must be eaten on a Monday or Thursday,
and never on Friday.<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

<p>In Welsh tradition the water-sprites are thought to
keep an especially watchful eye over the sea on Fridays,
making it rough and tempestuous.</p>

<p>On a Friday morning in the year 1600, says an old
legend, a ship set sail from a Northern port, having on
board a young man and a maiden of rare beauty, whose
strange actions and demeanor seemed to betoken that
they were supernatural beings. The vessel never
reached port, but one stormy night a phantom ship
was seen, enveloped in an uncanny light; and on its
deck stood the youth and his sweetheart, a weird vision,
as the spectral craft moved along over the stormy sea
against the wind.<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>In Hesse Frau Hölle, the modern Freyja, is the special
guardian and protectress of newly married people,
and so tenacious has been this old belief in the minds
of the Hessian peasants that the day of Venus is still
in high favor among them as the most propitious for
weddings.<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>

<p>In some places it is unlucky to receive any news,
whether good or bad, on a Friday; and, according to
a Shropshire saying, “if you hear anything new on a
Friday, it gives you another wrinkle on your face, and
adds another year to your age.”<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> Indeed, the term
“Friday-faced” was used to denote a gloomy or dejected
visage, as in the following quotation:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Marry, out upon him! what a friday-fac’d slave it is! I
think in my conscience his face never keeps holiday.<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In Servia children born on Friday are thought to be
invulnerable to the assaults of the whole army of hags
and sorcerers. In Germany Friday is reckoned the
most fateful of all the week-days, whether for good or
evil. The beliefs vary in different portions of the empire,
but there is a universal prejudice against setting
out on a journey, moving into a new house, or changing
servants on this day. In eastern Prussia, whoever
bakes on a Friday will get but little bread; but Sunday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
baptisms are thought to offset the unlucky auspices of
children born on Friday. The North German farmers
consider Friday the best day on which to begin gathering
the harvest.<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>

<p>In olden times Friday was the most favorable day
for courtship and weddings in Germany, and, unless a
bride first entered her new home on that day, domestic
strife was likely to ensue.</p>

<p>If she wished to tame a bad-tempered husband, her
first care was to prepare for him a soup made with the
rain-water of a Friday’s shower. The magic charm of
words wherewith cattle were freed from the mange was
spoken on a Friday morning; and a hare which had
been shot on the first Friday in March was of great
therapeutic value, especially its eyes, which were dried
and carried about as a sovereign remedy for defective
vision.</p>

<p>Only on a Friday did the church-bells strike the hour
for the release of bewitched spirits, and the delivery of
enchanted souls from their spells.<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></p>

<p>Doctor M. Höfler, in his “Volksmedizin und Aberglauben
in Oberbayern” (p. 208), says that Bavarian
peasants still cherish many superstitions about the sixth
day of the week, the day sacred to Freyja, the old German
Goddess of Love. Moreover, wonderful amuletic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
virtues are attributed to hens’ eggs laid during Good
Friday night, and whoever eats these eggs is thought
to be thereby insured against bodily harm. How long
this immunity holds good does not appear; but probably
until another Good Friday night egg is eaten. In
farmers’ households these precious eggs are therefore
eagerly sought by the house-mistress, who is wont to
give them to her husband and the farm-hands; or else
she uses them as an ingredient of the dough figures
which ornament the Easter bread.</p>

<p>In some districts of Hungary the following peculiar
custom is in vogue:—</p>

<p>Whenever any one’s name-day happens on a Friday,
that person selects a piece of one of his cast-off garments,
rubs thereon a few drops of his own blood and
saliva, and then burns the fragment of clothing. By
so doing he burns up also all the ill luck which else
might have befallen him during the next year. In
southeastern Transylvania a rag mystically dealt with
as above is hung on a tree before sunrise on the day
in question; if it disappear before dawn of the next
day, the person who thus superstitiously celebrates the
occurrence of his name-day on a Friday may laugh
at ill luck for a year.<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>

<p>The Magyars begin no work on a Friday, for it is
bound to miscarry; neither do they give any milk out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
of the house on that day, for by so doing they imagine
the usefulness of the cow to be impaired. In Bihar
County, Hungary, a loaf of bread baked on Friday
and impaled upon a stick is accounted a safeguard
against the spread of fire. The natives of this district
likewise entertain various curious fancies which are
decidedly unique. For example, when a newly born
child is knock-kneed, the mother regards it as a changeling.
She therefore seats herself on the threshold
on a Tuesday or Friday, when witches are abroad, and
peremptorily addresses those creatures, demanding the
restoration of her own child, whom she believes they
have stolen away. “Pfui! Pfui! you scoundrels!”
she exclaims, “give it back!”<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></p>

<p>The Sicilians have a host of superstitions on this
subject. The following are among the more interesting
items of their folk-lore relating to Friday. On
this day the owner of a rented house will not hand
over the keys to a new tenant, neither would the latter
receive them. In the southern part of the province of
Palermo no thief dares steal on a Friday, and the
accuracy of this statement is corroborated by the
criminal statistics. Indeed, on this day the most timid
householder may journey in safety anywhere in the
province, a fact which the sagacious traveler in a land
notorious for brigandage will not fail to note. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
immunity is not attributable to any special veneration
for Freyja’s day, but rather to a popular belief that
thefts and other misdemeanors then committed are sure
of speedy detection. Laughter is thought to offend
the goddess, and the proverb runs, “He who laughs on
Friday weeps on Saturday.” In an anonymous manuscript
in the municipal library of Palermo appears a
statement that whoever cuts out garments on a Tuesday
or a Friday runs the risk of making them too short and
of losing the cloth. Such clothing has little wear in it,
for nothing begun on these days has any durability.<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></p>

<p>The inhabitants of ancient Gascony are no less
credulous, as is apparent from the following bits of
Friday lore. Any one rash enough to start on a
journey on horseback runs especial risk of falling off
his horse, and of being drowned in attempting to ford
a stream. It has even happened that newly baked
loaves have been found tinged with blood in the oven.
However, Friday is a good day for making vinegar,
and the casks filled at three o’clock in the afternoon of
that day are found to be superior to others. This is
because our Lord, while on the cross, was given vinegar
to drink, mingled with gall, at three o’clock on the
afternoon of Good Friday.<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>In Normandy, also, Friday is the favorite day for
putting water in wine or cider, for the people believe
that on any other day the mixture would become sour.<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p>According to a quaint Italian belief, whoever is born
on a Friday will be of sanguine temperament, passionate,
light-hearted, and handsome. He will delight in
music, both vocal and instrumental, and will have a
liking for fine clothes. Moreover, he will be voluble in
speech, though of unstable character.<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<p>The Tyrolese have a saying, “Whoever is born on
a Friday must experience trouble,” and they regard it
as folly to marry on that day.<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></p>

<p>The French people share fully the general distrust
of the sixth day of the week. This is shown by statistics
of the Parisian theatres, where there are produced
on an average nearly two hundred new pieces annually,
and for many years not one of these has had its first
performance on a Friday.<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<p>In Alsace Wednesday and Friday are unlucky days,
and the former is never chosen for a wedding or baptism.
But of the two, Friday is the more undesirable,
and no business of importance is done thereon, nor any
journey undertaken. It is foremost among witch days,
for evil spirits are then abroad, and their activity on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
Friday is proverbial. These sentiments prevail in other
German districts, and are entertained by people of cultivation
and learning. Indeed, it may be affirmed truly
that the possession of intellectual force is by no means
incompatible with a superstitious belief in the luck or
misfortune of particular days. The credulousness of
the great Napoleon in this regard is well known. Bismarck
is said to have once written to his wife from
Letzlingen, a village of Prussian Saxony: “I have not
had such good luck in hunting to-day as I had three
years ago; but then—it is a Friday.”<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> The French
statesman, Gambetta, is reported to have arranged his
journeyings and business affairs with reference to auspicious
hours, as determined by a professional reader
of cards; and President Felix Faure, we are told, is
similarly credulous. Indeed, so prevalent are notions
of this kind in the French capital that tastefully ornamented
cards with a list of “hours to be avoided” find
a ready sale in the streets.<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></p>

<p>Among the Slavonians St. Prascovia, the modern
successor of Venus and Freyja, is believed to visit the
peasants’ houses every Friday, and woe to the luckless
woman whom she then finds engaged in certain
occupations. Local tradition says that sewing, spinning,
and weaving on that day are sinful, and are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
especially distasteful to St. Prascovia, familiarly known
as “Mother Friday,” because the dust so produced gets
into her eyes. She is very apt to take revenge by
inflicting upon the offenders divers physical ailments,
such as sore eyes, whitlows, or hang-nails. In some
districts the peasants retire earlier than usual on
Friday evenings, under the impression that Mother
Friday will punish those whom she may find awake
when she makes her evening visits. These popular
beliefs are exemplified in the following tradition:—</p>

<p>There was once a certain woman who did not pay
due reverence to Mother Friday, but set to work on a
distaff full of flax, combing it and whirling it. She
spun away until dinner-time, then sleep fell upon her.
Suddenly the door opened, and in came Mother Friday,
before the eyes of all who were there, clad in a white
dress, and in such a rage! And she went straight up
to the woman who had been spinning, and scooped up
from the floor a handful of the dust that had fallen
out of the flax, and began stuffing and stuffing that
woman’s eyes full of it! After she had stuffed them
full, she went off in a rage,—disappeared without
saying a word.</p>

<p>When the woman awoke, she began squalling, at the
top of her voice, about her eyes, but could not tell what
was the matter with them. The other women, who
had been much frightened, began to cry out: “Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
you wretch, you! you’ve brought a terrible punishment
on yourself from Mother Friday.” Then they
told her all that had taken place. She listened to
it all, and then began imploring: “Mother Friday,
forgive me! Pardon me, the guilty one! I’ll offer
thee a taper, and I’ll never let friend or foe dishonor
thee, mother!”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think? During the night, back
came Mother Friday, and took the dust out of that
woman’s eyes, so that she was able to get about again.
It’s a great sin to dishonor Mother Friday, combing
and spinning flax, forsooth!”<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a></p>

<p>Professor Max Müller, in his “Contributions to the
Science of Mythology” (New York and Bombay, 1897),
cites a tradition of the as yet little known mythology
of the Mordvinians, a Finnish race inhabiting the middle
Volga provinces of Russia. A woman who had
been working all day long on a Friday, baking bread
for some orphan children, was taken up in a dream to
the sun, and when she was nearly exhausted, owing to
the effects of the heat, and to the rapidly increasing
size of a piece of dough which she had put into her
mouth, she was accosted by Chkaï, the large-eyed
Mordvine sun-god, who told her that she was being
punished because she had baked bread for the orphans
on a Friday. She was charged, moreover, to tell all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the people so. “But who will be such a fool as to
believe me?” asked the woman most disrespectfully.
Thereupon Chkaï placed his mark in scarlet and blue
upon her forehead,—an emblem which is thought to
bring luck. And after that the Mordvine women were
careful to bake no bread, nor to do any other work, on
a Friday.</p>

<p>It was a very early custom in England to appoint
Friday as the day for the execution of criminals, and
until recently the same was true in this country, but
through the persistent efforts of the “Thirteen Club,”
of New York, whose object is the discouragement of
certain popular superstitions, the sixth day of the week
has been partially relieved of the odium of being
“hangman’s day” in the United States.</p>

<p>A writer of an inventive turn of mind has suggested
that Friday’s unpopularity is partly owing to its being
late in the week and money runs short to the poor.
Saturday being the close of the week, and pay-day as
well, there is no time then to be superstitious.</p>

<p>Some modern writers have displayed a misguided
zeal in the collection of statistical evidence that Friday
has been a most auspicious day in American history,
and have cited among other events the surrender of
Burgoyne at Saratoga, and that of Cornwallis at Yorktown,
as occurring on that day. But will such an
argument appeal with success to English readers? If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
by general consent we should teach our children that
Friday was the luckiest day of the week, evidence in
favor of this theory would no doubt rapidly accumulate,
and the new belief would soon be worth just as
much as the old one.</p>

<h2 id="SUPERSTITIOUS_DEALINGS_WITH">SUPERSTITIOUS DEALINGS WITH
ANIMALS</h2>

<h3>I. RATS AND MICE AS AVENGERS</h3>

<p>When in ancient times fields were overrun and crops
destroyed by swarms of pestiferous animals or insects,
these creatures were regarded either as agents of the
Devil, or as being themselves veritable demons. We
learn, moreover, that rats and mice were formerly
especial objects of superstition, and that their actions
were carefully noted as auguries of good or evil.<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> A
rabbinical myth says that the rat and the hog were
created by Noah as scavengers of the Ark; but the rat
becoming a nuisance, the patriarch evoked a cat from
the lion’s nose.<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> In the “Horapollon,” the only ancient
work now known which attempted to explain Egyptian
hieroglyphics, the rat is represented as a symbol of destruction.
But the Egyptians also regarded this animal
as a type of good judgment, because, when afforded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
choice of several pieces of bread, he always selects the
best.<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a></p>

<p>According to an early legend, the Teucri, or founders
of the Trojan race, on leaving the island of Crete to
found a colony elsewhere, were instructed by an oracle
to choose as a residence that place where they should
first be attacked by the aborigines of the country. On
encamping for the night, a swarm of mice appeared and
gnawed the leathern thongs of their armor, and accordingly
they made that spot their home and erected a
temple to Apollo Smintheus,<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> this title being derived
from the word meaning “a rat” in the Æolic dialect.
In ancient Troas mice were objects of worship; and
the Greek writer, Heraclides Ponticus, said that they
were held especially sacred at Chrysa, a town famous
for its temple of Apollo. At Hamaxitus, too, mice were
fed at the public expense.<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> Herodotus relates, on the
authority of certain priests, that when in the year <span class="smcapuc">B. C.</span>
699 Egypt was invaded by an Assyrian army under
Sennacherib, it was revealed in a vision to the Egyptian
king, Sethon, that he should receive assistance from the
gods. And on the eve of an expected battle the camp
of the Assyrians was attacked by a legion of field-mice,
who destroyed their quivers and bows, so that, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
without serviceable weapons, the invaders fled in dismay
on the ensuing morning. And in memory of this
fabulous event a stone statue of King Sethon, bearing a
mouse in his hand, was erected in the temple of Vulcan
at Memphis, with this inscription: “Whoever looks on
me, let him revere the Gods.”</p>

<p>Cicero, in his treatise on Divination, while commenting
on the absurdity of the prevalent belief in prodigies,
remarked that, if reliance were to be placed in
omens of this kind, he ought naturally to tremble for
the safety of the Commonwealth, because mice had
recently nibbled a copy of Plato’s “Republic” in his
library. Pliny wrote that rats foretold the Marsian
war, <span class="smcapuc">B. C.</span> 89, by destroying silver shields and bucklers
at Lavinium, an ancient city near Rome; and that they
also prognosticated the death of the Roman general,
Carbo, by eating his hose-garters and shoe-strings at
Clusium, the modern Chiusi, in Etruria. The same
writer, in the eighth book of his “Natural History,”
devotes a short chapter to an enumeration of instances,
fabulous or historical, in which the inhabitants of
several cities of the Roman Empire were driven from
their homes by noxious animals, reptiles, and insects.
He states, on the authority of the Greek moralist, Theophrastus
(<span class="smcapuc">B. C.</span> 372-287), that the natives of the island
of Gyaros, one of the Cyclades, were forced to abandon
their homes owing to the ravages of rats and mice, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
devoured everything they could find, even including
iron substances.</p>

<p>When the Philistines took the ark of the Lord from
the camp of the Israelites, as recorded in 1 Samuel iv.,
a plague of mice was sent to devastate their lands;
whereupon the Philistines returned the ark, together
with a trespass-offering, which included five golden
mice, as an atonement for their sacrilegious act.</p>

<p>In mediæval legendary lore rats figure not unfrequently
as avengers. The Polish king, Popiel II., who
ascended the throne in the year 820, rendered himself
obnoxious to his subjects by his immorality and tyranny,
and, according to tradition, Heaven sent against him a
multitude of rats, which pursued him constantly. The
king and his family sought refuge in a castle situated
on an island in the middle of Lake Goplo, on the Prussian
frontier. But the rats finally invaded this stronghold
and devoured the king and all belonging to him.</p>

<p>Again, in the year 970, so runs the legend, Hatto II.,
Archbishop of Mayence, who had made himself hateful
to his people on account of his avarice and cruelty during
a season of famine, was informed by one of his
servants that a vast multitude of rats were advancing
along the roads leading to the palace. The bishop
betook himself at once to a tower in the middle of the
Rhine, near Bingen, still known as the “Mouse Tower,”
where he sought safety from his pursuers. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
rats swam out to the tower, gnawed through its walls,
and devoured him. We read also in “A Chronicle of
the Kings of England” that, in the reign of William
the Conqueror, a great lord was attacked by mice at a
banquet, and “though he were removed from land to
sea and from sea to land again,” the mice pursued him
to his death.</p>

<p>Rats and mice were not, however, the only agents
employed as avengers. In the year 350, during a long
siege of the Roman stronghold, Nisibis, in Mesopotamia,
by the Persian king, Sapor II., the inhabitants
besought their bishop, St. James, to utter a malediction
against the enemy. Accordingly the prelate, standing
on one of the wall towers, prayed God that a host of
flies might be sent to attack the Persians, and tradition
has it that the prayer was answered at once. A
multitude of the insects descended upon the besiegers,
their horses, and elephants; and men and animals, thus
goaded to frenzy, were compelled to retreat, and so the
siege was raised. The Philistines of old worshiped a
special deity, Beelzebub, to whom they attributed the
power of destroying flies.<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> This same region is still
infested with insect plagues; but the modern traveler,
who has no faith in Beelzebub, is more likely to employ
fly-traps and energetic practical measures.</p>

<p>Such are a few instances of the supernatural employment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
of vermin and insects as instruments of vengeance;
and we need hardly wonder that, conversely,
people in olden times should avail themselves of supernatural
methods in order to protect themselves or their
property from the ravages of these noxious creatures.</p>

<p>In Mexico rats were anciently the objects of superstitious
regard, for they were credited with possessing
a keen insight into the characters of all members of a
household, and were wont publicly to announce flagrant
breaches of morality on the part of such members
by gnawing various articles of domestic furniture, such
as mats and baskets. It does not appear, however,
that the rodents were sagacious enough to indicate
the individual whose conduct had aroused their displeasure.</p>

<p>The Mexicans had also a superstition that whoever
partook of food which had been gnawed by rats would
be falsely accused of some wrong-doing.<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></p>

<h3>II. SPIRITS ASSUME THE FORMS OF BLACK ANIMALS</h3>

<p>The belief in the demoniacal possession of animals
was prevalent in Europe for several centuries, and in
order to drive away the evil spirits it was customary to
employ various exorcisms and incantations, which were
supposed to be infallible after approval by ecclesiastical
authority. Reginald Scot, in his “Discovery of Witchcraft,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
says that, according to the testimony of reliable
authors, spirits were wont to take the forms of animals,
and especially of horses, dogs, swine, goats, and hares.
They also appeared in the guise of crows and owls, but
took the most delight in the likenesses of snakes and
dragons. Bewitched animals were usually of a black
color. A black cat is the traditional companion or
familiar of witches the world over, and the black dog
is also associated with sorcery in the folk-lore of some
lands. Among the Slavs the black demon Cernabog
has this form, and the black hen is a common devil-symbol
in mediæval witch-lore. The gypsies believe,
moreover, that black horses are gifted with a supernatural
sight, which enables them to see beings invisible
to the eye of man.<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> Black animals figure prominently
in many legends of the dark ages. Thus the Devil, in
the form of a black horse, disturbed a congregation
which had gathered to listen to a sermon delivered by
St. Peter of Verona in the thirteenth century, but was
put to flight by the sign of the cross.<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> Among birds
the crow is considered an ominous creature in some
countries, and in northeast Scotland is always associated
with the “black airt.”<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> The raven, too, is traditionally
portentous, and is sometimes called the Devil’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
bird; its plumage is said to have been changed from
white to black on account of its disobedience.<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> In
Swedish legend the magpie shares the evil reputation
of the raven and crow, and is characterized as “a
mystic bird, a downright witches’ bird, belonging to
the Devil and the other powers of the night.”<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a></p>

<p>The Kirghis, a nomadic people of Turkestan, are
very superstitious in regard to the magpie, and note
with care the direction whence the sound of its cry is
heard. If from the north, it portends evil; from the
south, a remarkable occurrence; from the east, it
denotes the coming of guests; and from the west, a
journey.<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></p>

<p>The Rev. Alexander Stewart, in his “Nether Lochaber,”
deprecates as unreasonable the universal distrust
of the magpie. It seems probably that this is due less
to its color than to certain other characteristics; for
the magpie is a confirmed mimic and kleptomaniac, and
of exceeding slyness withal.</p>

<p>Apropos of crows as foreboders, whether of good or
evil, an amusing story is told of a man who wished to
test for himself the truth or falsity of a popular belief
that seeing a couple of crows in the early morning is a
sign of good luck. He therefore directed his servant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
to awaken him at daybreak whenever two crows were
to be seen. Accordingly one morning the servant
called him, but in the mean time one of the birds had
flown away. Thereupon the master became angry and
gave his servant a sound beating, upbraiding him with
having delayed until but one crow remained. The
servant, however, nothing daunted, replied: “Lo, sir,
have you not seen the luck which is come to me from
seeing two crows?”<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a></p>

<p>Superstition has been defined as “a belief not in
accordance with the facts,” but this is manifestly incorrect.
An ignorant person, who thinks that black
cats are more evil-minded than white ones, thereby
cherishes a mistaken idea, but is not necessarily superstitious.
If, however, he believes that a black cat or
any other animal is endowed with a supernatural
faculty of exerting evil influences over human beings,
then he is not only ignorant, but also superstitious.</p>

<h3>III. EXORCISM AND CONJURATION OF VERMIN</h3>

<p>The Grecian husbandmen were accustomed to drive
away mice by writing them a message on a piece of
paper and sticking it on a stone in the infested field.
A specimen of such a message, beginning with an adjuration
and concluding with a threat, is to be found in
the “Geoponica,” a Grecian agricultural treatise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>In the endeavor to justify the employment of radical
measures against vermin, some curious questions of
casuistry were involved. Rats and mice being God’s
creatures, one ought not to take their lives. But it
was considered entirely proper to drive them off one’s
own domain, while recommending as preferable the
well-stocked cellar of a neighbor. Formulæ of exorcism,
or sentences containing warnings to depart, were
written on scraps of paper, which were then well
greased and rolled into little balls, or wrapped about
poisoned edibles, and placed in the rat-holes.<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p>

<p>Conjurations of vermin were usually in the name of
St. Gertrude, the first abbess of Nivelle in Belgium,
and also the patron saint of travelers and cats, and
protectress against the ravages of the smaller rodents.</p>

<p>The Spanish ecclesiastic, Martin Azpilcueta, surnamed
Navarre, stated that when rats were exorcised,
it was customary to banish them formally from the
territory of Spain; and the creatures would then proceed
to the seashore and swim to some remote island,
where they made their home.</p>

<p>The public records of Hameln, in the kingdom of
Hannover, state that in the year 1284 a stranger, in
gay and fantastic attire, visited the town and proclaimed
himself a professional rat-catcher, offering for
a consideration to rid the place of the vermin which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
infested it. The townsfolk having agreed to his proposal,
the stranger began to play a tune upon his pipe,
whereupon the rats emerged in swarms from their
hiding-places and followed him to the river Weser,
where they were all drowned. The people of Hameln
now repented of their bargain and refused to pay the
full amount agreed upon, for the alleged reason that
the rats had been driven away by the aid of sorcery.
In revenge for this, the piper played the same tune
on the next day, and immediately all the children of
the town followed him to a cavern in the side of a
neighboring hill, called the Koppenberg. The piper
and the children entered the cavern, which closed after
them; and in remembrance of this tragic event several
memorials are to be seen in Hameln. Indeed, some
writers maintain that the legend has an historical foundation,
and such appears to have been the opinion of
the townspeople, inasmuch as for years afterwards public
and legal documents were dated from the mournful
occurrence.</p>

<p>An old tradition says that mice originally fell upon
the earth from the clouds during a thunder-storm, and
hence these animals are emblematic of storms; they are
also mystical creatures, and have a relationship with
Donar, Wodan, and Frigg. In Bavaria profanity is
thought to increase the number of mice in a dwelling,
and their appearance in the fields in large numbers indicates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
war, pestilence, or famine.<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> Bohemian peasants
are wont to make a certain provision for these elfish
rodents; on Christmas Eve and on the first holiday
of the year, whatever food remains from the midday
meal is thrown upon the barn floor, and the following
sentence is repeated: “O mice, eat these remnants
and leave the grain in peace!” On Christmas
Eve, also, peas are placed in heaps, shaped like a cross,
in the four corners of a mouse-infested room, lest
the vermin get the upper hand and the premises be
overrun. In eastern Prussia, when the harvest is
gathered, the last sheaf of corn is left standing in the
field, while the peasants surround it and sing a hymn
as an incantation against future devastation of their
lands by rats or mice. Or, when the corn is harvested,
three inverted sheaves are fixed upon the barn floor for
a like purpose.<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a></p>

<p>According to a Bohemian legend, the mouse was
originally a creation of the Devil, at the time when
Noah entered the Ark, attended by the members of his
family and followed by a numerous retinue of animals.
The Devil, so runs the tale, hated the patriarch for his
piety, and with evil intent created the mouse, whom he
sent to gnaw a hole in the side of the Ark, through
which the water might enter. But God then created<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
the cat, who pursued and devoured the mouse, thus
frustrating the design of the Evil One.<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a></p>

<p>At the siege of Angers, the ancient capital of Anjou,
in the year 845, during the reign of King Charles the
Bald, the French were much annoyed by swarms of
grasshoppers of unusual size. They were duly exorcised
according to the custom of the times, and having
been put to flight, are reported to have precipitated
themselves into a river.<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></p>

<p>The French writer, St. Foix, in his “Essais historiques
sur Paris,” has recorded that in the year 1120,
the Bishop of Laon, in the Department of Aisne, pronounced
an injunction against field-mice, on account
of their ravages; and St. Bernard, a contemporary of
that prelate, while preaching at Foigny in the same
diocese, in order to relieve his congregation of the
annoyance caused by a multitude of flies, repeated
a formula of excommunication against them, whereat,
according to monkish records, the flies fell dead in
heaps and were gathered up with shovels.</p>

<p>The early Anglo-Saxons not only made use of amulets
of wood or other material, on which were engraven
Runic characters, to secure protection from elves and
demons,<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> but they carried about with them the herb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
called periwinkle, of the botanical genus <i lang="la">Vinca</i>, as a
charm against snakes and wild animals.<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></p>

<h3>IV. CHARMS AGAINST ANIMALS</h3>

<p>As illustrative of the superstitious use of charms and
exorcisms against animals and reptiles in different epochs
and countries, we have examples from many and varied
sources.</p>

<p>The Egyptians used, as charms against venomous
serpents, various magic formulæ inscribed upon strips
of papyrus, which were rolled up and worn as talismans.
A specimen of such an one is to be seen among
the Egyptian manuscripts in the Louvre collection.
The following is a translation of a portion of one of
these incantations, which invokes the aid of a god to
protect the bearer against wild animals and reptiles:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Come to me, O Lord of Gods, drive far from me the lions
coming from the earth, the crocodiles issuing from the river,
the mouth of all biting reptiles coming out of their holes.<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Pliny recommended a particular herb as an amulet
against serpents and vipers. This herb, to which he
gives no less than five Latin names, appears to be identical
with the <i lang="la">Anchusa officinalis</i> of modern pharmacopœias,
the bugloss or ox-tongue of southern Europe, a
plant now seldom used in therapeutics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>The Grecians also were doubtless addicted to the
superstitious use of charms against animals, although
there is good authority for the statement that the citizens
of ancient Athens did not hesitate on occasion to
accelerate the flight of “ominous creatures, as cats and
the like,” by throwing stones or other handy missiles
at them in the night, a method wholly mundane and
natural.<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> And in this connection we may quote the
opinion of the Rev. Father Pierre Le Brun, in his
“Histoire critique des pratiques superstitieuses” (Amsterdam,
1733). The learned writer remarks that, if it
were desired to drive a strange dog out of one’s room,
it would be quite unsuitable to <em>begin</em> with prayer and
the use of holy water. One should rather first open
the door and take hold of a stick, or throw some food
outside; and if these and other practical measures fail,
then recourse may be had to supernatural expedients,
provided these have ecclesiastical sanction.</p>

<p>In a treatise against superstition by a French <i lang="fr">savant</i>,
Martin of Arles, published in 1650, it was stated that
the friars of the monastery of Ardennes were wont to
boast that no rats could thrive in their neighborhood,
and that this fact was due to the merits of St. Ulric,
Bishop of Augsburg, some of whose relics were deposited
in their church. In this monastery also it had
been formerly customary to scatter crumbs of bread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
which had been blessed, in places infested by vermin,
and the monks believed that this procedure either
caused the death of the animals or frightened them
away.</p>

<p>Thuringian houses are sometimes cleared of rats in
the following manner: Before sunrise on Good Friday
morning, the master of the house, barefooted and in
his shirt-sleeves, goes through every room blowing on a
tiny whistle made out of the thigh bone of a rat’s hind
leg.<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> Another curious method of expelling vermin
from a dwelling is in vogue in some portions of the
Austrian Empire. Before the dawn of a principal feast
day, one must take an old shoe which has not been
recently cleaned, and lay it on the ground at a place
where two roads cross. No word must meanwhile be
spoken aloud, but a <cite>Paternoster</cite> is to be silently repeated.
The direction in which the shoe points indicates
the course to be taken by the rats in their flight.<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>
In the village of Bechlin, a few miles north of Prague,
troublesome mice are thus dealt with: Very early on
an Easter Sunday morning, before the bells have rung
for the first Mass, the peasant matron collects and
fastens together all the house-keys. Then she waits
until the first stroke of the bell for High Mass at noon,
whereupon she proceeds to the cellar, meanwhile jingling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
the keys vigorously so long as the church-bells
ring; when they cease she retraces her steps, still rattling
the keys; and these measures are believed to
permanently frighten away the mice.<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p>

<p>Towards the middle of the seventeenth century a
great army of locusts invaded the fields in the neighborhood
of the town of Mixco, in Guatemala. So
numerous were they as for a time to obscure the light
of the sun, and to break the branches of the trees
whereon they clung; and they speedily devoured the
corn and other crops. Moreover, they covered the
highways and startled the traveling mules by their
fluttering movements. By order of the magistrates,
the people of the country assembled in the fields with
trumpets and other instruments in order to scare
away the unwelcome visitors. Idols were brought out,
especially pictures of the Virgin and of St. Nicholas
Tolentine. From the country regions near and far
came the Spanish farmers to the town of Mixco, with
propitiatory offerings for the saint, and all brought
with them loaves of bread to be blessed. These loaves
they carried back to their farms, and either threw into
their cornfields or buried beneath their hedges, hoping
by this method to protect their crops from the
locusts.<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>The mountain ash, or rowan-tree (the Scotch <em>roun-tree</em>),
is thought to have derived its name from the
Latin word <i lang="la">runa</i>, an incantation, because of its employment
in magical arts. Woe to the witch who is touched
by a branch of this tree in the hand of a christened
man!<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a></p>

<p>Much has been written concerning the folk-lore of
the mountain ash, and it is indeed a powerful rival
of the horse-shoe in its talismanic virtues, though not
as a luck-bringer.</p>

<p>But for the protection of cattle from the incursions
of witches, not even the horse-shoe may assume to usurp
the rowan’s prestige. Branches of this favorite tree,
when hung over the stalls of cows or wreathed about
their horns, are potent to avert the evil glances or
contact, whether of witches or malicious fairies. And
their efficacy is enhanced if the farmer is careful to
repeat at regular intervals the following fervent petition:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>From Witches and Wizards, and long-tailed Buzzards,
and creeping things that run in hedge-bottoms, good Lord,
deliver us!</p>

</div>

<p>Jamieson, in his “Scottish Dictionary,” remarks that
this practice of twining the rowan about the horns of
cows bears a certain resemblance to an ancient custom
of the Romans in their <i lang="la">Palilia</i>, or feast celebrated at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
the end of April, whose object was the preservation of
the flocks. He says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The Shepherd, in order to purify his sheep, was in the
dusk of the evening to bedew the ground around them with
a wet branch, then to adorn the fold with leaves and <em>green
branches</em> and to cover the door with garlands.</p>

</div>

<p>In China it is customary for the Taouist priests to
perform certain magical rites on the completion of a
new pigsty, and before the admission of the animals
to their new quarters. An altar is erected in honor of
the Chu-Lan-Too-Tee, or genii of pigsties, and the
walls of the compartments of the sty are adorned with
strips of red paper, upon which are Chinese characters,
signifying, “Let the enemies of horses, cows, sheep,
fowls, dogs, and pigs be appeased.”<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a></p>

<h3>V. IMAGES OF ANIMALS AND BIRDS USED AS CHARMS</h3>

<p>The belief that cities or towns may be protected from
the incursions of noxious animals, birds, or insects, by
an image or figure representing one of these creatures,
is of great antiquity. This seems to be on the principle
of the homœopathic doctrine, “Like cures like.”
A homely illustration of the same idea is afforded by
the shrewd farmer who hangs up a dead crow in his
cornfield to protect the crops. On the other hand, the
eccentric French writer, Antoine Mizauld, recommended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
the following as an effective charm for attracting a
large number of crows to one spot: As soon as the
constellation of the Virgin rises above the horizon, the
figure of a half crow is to be painted on a piece of
cloth, while these words are repeated: “Let no crow
in all this district move away without coming to this
image, in whatever spot it may be buried.” The piece
of cloth, with its magical figure, is then interred and
the charm is complete.<a name="FNanchor_485" id="FNanchor_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a></p>

<p>Apollonius of Tyana in Cappadocia, the philosopher
and pretended magician of the first century, is said to
have freed Antioch from scorpions and flies by means
of the brazen image of a scorpion. The French bishop,
Gregory of Tours, mentions an ancient popular belief
that no serpents or dormice were to be seen in Paris.
In his time, however, or toward the close of the sixth
century, while workmen were removing the mud which
covered one of the arches of the Bridge of Paris, they
found imbedded therein two brazen images of a serpent
and dormouse, which were taken away; and thenceforth,
he says, the city was infested by prodigious
numbers of dormice and snakes. In Jean Baptiste
Thiers’s treatise on Superstitions (Paris, 1679), we find
allusion to a serpent of brass at Constantinople, which
long served as a talisman to bar the entrance of living
serpents. But when the city was captured by Mahomet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
II. in 1453, that monarch broke the teeth of the
image by the force of an arrow-shot; and immediately
a legion of serpents attacked the inhabitants, but without
doing them any harm, for the teeth of all were
broken. In the reign of Charlemagne it was customary
in Piedmont to use a formula for blessing holy
water with which to drive away noxious animals from
the crops, and with such success that not a single
mole could be found in the whole town of Aosta, nor
within three thousand paces beyond its boundaries.</p>

<p>Mr. Andrew Lang, in his volume entitled “Custom
and Myth,” says that, in a church of a certain old
Saxon town, the verger is wont to exhibit to visitors a
silver mouse dedicated to Our Lady; explaining that
the town was infested with mice until this now precious
relic was presented by some ladies as a propitiatory
offering, whereupon the creatures disappeared at once.</p>

<p>According to the ancient Doctrine of Signatures,
the therapeutic virtues of plants were indicated by
certain peculiarities of their external appearance.
Thus <i lang="la">Dracontium</i>, or great dragon, a plant which has
a fancied resemblance to this mythical monster, was
thought to be a preservative against serpents; and the
scorpion-grass (<i lang="la">Myosotis</i>), whose flower-spike was not
unlike a scorpion’s tail, was deemed an antidote to the
stings of noxious insects.</p>

<p>Indeed, the old herbalists of England claimed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
sole use of herbs, not only to cure all fleshly ills, but to
drive away or keep at a distance wolves, leopards, and
all venomous wild beasts.<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

<p>In Tibet, according to L. Austine Waddell, M. B.,
ferocious mastiffs are permitted to roam at large in the
night, a source of terror to wayfarers, who therefore
carry about charms consisting of “the picture of a dog
muzzled and fettered by a chain, terminated by the
mystic and all-powerful thunderbolt sceptre,” while
along the dog’s body are written certain Sanskrit magical
sentences.<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></p>

<h3>VI. WORDS USED AS CHARMS</h3>

<p>The English word “charm” is derived from the Latin
<i lang="la">carmen</i>, a verse; and the magical potency of a sentence
used as a charm was believed to rest in the words themselves,
and not in the person who uttered them. In
the opinion of the cabalistic magicians of the Middle
Ages, the power of a charm of words depended upon its
being unintelligible.</p>

<p>The Latin poet, Varius, wrote in the first century <span class="smcapuc">B. C.</span>
that old women, by the sole use of words as charms,
were able not only to restrain and subjugate wild animals
and serpents, but also to drive away noxious creatures
and vermin. Few early writers allude to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
practice, which appears, however, to have been much in
vogue in different countries towards the close of the
mediæval period. The Swiss theologian, Felix Hammerlein
(1389-1457), wrote of a peasant living near
Zurich who was able, by repeating a magic formula, to
rid infested premises of adders, vipers, lizards, and
other reptiles;<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> and in some parts of Normandy it was
a custom formerly to place small rolls of hay under the
fruit trees. The hay was then set on fire by means
of torches carried by young children, who repeated
meanwhile: “Mice, caterpillars, and moles, get out of
my field; I will burn your beard and your bones; trees
and shrubs, give me three bushels of apples.” Hampson
remarks that this incantation somewhat resembles
one employed by the ancient Grecians against beetles,
whom they held responsible for the destruction of their
corn. These magical lines are thus translated: “Fly,
beetles, the ravenous wolf pursues you.”<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a></p>

<p>It was currently reported among the ancients that
the famous philosopher, Pythagoras, not only possessed
the faculty of predicting storms and earthquakes, but
that he had by a magical word been enabled to tame
a Daunian bear, and had also prevented an ox from
eating beans by whispering in his ear.<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>Antoine Mizauld, the French physician and astrologer,
affirmed that, according to Ptolemy, in order to
drive away serpents, one should prepare a talisman by
engraving the figure of two serpents upon a square
piece of copper and pronouncing a charm of words as
follows: “With this image I forbid serpents to harm
any one, and command them to leave the place where it
shall be buried.” In like manner, says the same authority,
to expel rats and mice, one has only to represent
an image of one of these creatures upon a piece of tin
or copper, and at the proper time, as determined by
astrology, command them to depart.</p>

<p>In order to expel snakes, insects, and vermin from
their dwellings, the Bulgarian women of Turkey, on
the last day of February, endeavor to frighten the
creatures by beating copper vessels all over the house,
while shouting, “Out with you, snakes, scorpions, flies,
bugs, and fleas!” One of the vessels is then taken
into the court-yard, the pests being expected to follow
it. And in Serfo, an island of the Grecian archipelago,
at the commencement of the vintage a bunch
of grapes is thrown into each house to expel the vermin,
while this formula is repeated: “The black grape
will sicken you; the black grape will poison you! Out
with you, rats and fleas!”<a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a></p>

<p>In Albania, when locusts or cockchafers devastate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
fields, a number of women, having caught some of the
insects, form a mock funeral procession, and proceed to
drown them in some convenient stream. And while
on their way thither they chant in turn the following
dirge, which all repeat in chorus:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">O locusts, O cockchafers, parents kind,</div>
<div class="verse">Orphaned you have left us all behind.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And this proceeding is thought to be destructive to
the whole swarm of insects.<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a></p>

<p>The following charm against foxes was formerly used
in France, and was to be repeated thrice a week:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Foxes, both male and female, I conjure you in the name
of the Holy Trinity, that ye neither touch nor carry off any
of my fowls, whether roosters, hens or chickens; nor eat their
nests, nor suck their blood, nor break their eggs, nor do
them any harm whatever.<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The Roman Catholic Church formerly sanctioned the
use of certain sentences as charms against vipers, and
the following may serve as a specimen:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I conjure thee, O serpent, in this hour, by the five holy
wounds of Our Lord, that thou remove not out of this place,
as certainly as God was born of a pure Virgine. Otherwise,
I conjure thee, serpent, by Our Lady St. Mary, that thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
obey me, as wax obeyeth the fire, and as fire obeyeth water,
that thou neither hurt me nor any other Christian, as certainly
as God was born of an immaculate Virgine, in which
respect I take thee up. <i lang="la">In Nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus
Sancti</i>.… Otherwise, O vermine, thou must come as
God came unto the Jews.<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

</div>

<p>When a Turk chances to encounter a serpent, he is
wont to invoke the aid of Chah-Miran, the serpent-king,
and in the name of this deity he bids the reptile
depart. Now Chah-Miran has long been dead, but the
astute Turk reasons that serpents are not aware of this
fact, for, if they were, the human race would be helpless
against their attacks.<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<p>As preservatives from the stings of insects, and to
prevent the croaking of frogs, the Moslems use scraps
of paper containing magical formulæ, or sentences
from the Koran engraved on stones or pieces of metal;<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>
and a method formerly in vogue in France, to protect
pigeons from the incursions of scorpions, consisted in
writing the word “Adam” on each of the four walls
of the pigeon-house.<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></p>

<p>The natives of Mirzapur, in cases of scorpion-bite,
recite a charm meaning as follows: “Black scorpion
of the limestone, green thy tail and black thy mouth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
God orders thee to go home. Come out, scorpion, at
the spell. Come out, come out!”<a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a></p>

<p>The following charm against insects is in vogue in
Lesbos: In the evening a black-handled knife is stuck
in some spot where the insects congregate, and certain
Greek verses are repeated, of which the following is a
translation:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I got three naughty bairns together,</div>
<div class="verse">One a wasp, one caterpillar,</div>
<div class="verse">And a swarming ant the other.</div>
<div class="verse">Whate’er ye eat, whate’er ye drink,</div>
<div class="verse">Hence, hence avaunt,</div>
<div class="verse">To the hills and mountains flee,</div>
<div class="verse">And unto each fruitless tree.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The knife is to remain in the same spot until the
next morning, and is then to be removed. This completes
the charm, and the insects are expected to
depart at once.<a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p>

<p>In Great Britain there formerly prevailed a belief
that rats could be rhymed to death by anathematizing
them in metrical verse, a practice mentioned by Shakespeare
and contemporary poets, and which is even
to-day not wholly obsolete.<a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a></p>

<p>In southern Germany, during the campaigns of Napoleon
I., mice with inked feet were placed upon the map<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
of Europe, and their tracks were held to foretell the
routes by which the French soldiers would advance.<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p>

<p>The Hindus consider the rat to be a sacred animal,
and among the lower classes of the natives of western
India it is thought unlucky to call a rat by his own
name, so they speak of him as the “rat-uncle.”<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></p>

<h3>VII. SUPERSTITIOUS DEALINGS WITH WILD ANIMALS</h3>

<p>In encountering a wild animal, the ancients deemed
it a matter of great importance that a man should see
the beast before the latter was aware of a human presence.
If a wolf, for example, first perceived the man,
the brute was master of the situation, and the man was
bereft alike of speech and strength; whereas the wolf,
if first seen by the man, became an easy prey. The
side from which a wild beast approached was also of
moment. Thus the “Geoponica” warned its readers
not to allow a hyena to approach from the right side,
lest one be rendered motionless by the fascination of
its presence; but if it appeared on the left side, the
animal might be attacked with confidence.</p>

<p>Various wonderful tales are current among the natives
of Senegambia, and other districts of western
Africa, regarding the lion. This noble animal, it is
said, forbears to attack a man who salutes him with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
respectful gesture, and the same gallant instinct restrains
the beast from harming a woman.<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> In most
lion-haunted regions, however, the natives do not have
such implicit confidence in the courtesy and forbearance
of wild animals, but trust rather to the efficacy of
various amulets. The Kaffirs of southeastern Africa,
for example, on encountering a lion or leopard in the
forest, proceed at once to nibble a so-called lion-charm,
which is merely a small bit of wood or root. And if
the animal moves away without molesting him, the
Kaffir attributes his security to the magic power of
the charm, not realizing that his escape is due to the
natural dread of man which is characteristic of animals
generally.<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></p>

<p>So, too, the priests of Mexico were accustomed to
rub their bodies with a certain ointment which they believed
to be an efficient protection against wild beasts,
its pungent odor acting as a charm, so that they were
enabled to wander unmolested amid the wildest solitudes.<a name="FNanchor_505" id="FNanchor_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>
The skilled hunter, however, confident in his
own prowess, depends neither upon the alleged gallantry
of lions nor the potency of amulets, but rather
on his trusty rifle.</p>

<p>The belief in charms against noxious animals is widespread;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
for not alone in African jungles does this form
of superstition prevail: it is found among civilized
people as well, and more particularly in southern lands;
indeed, wherever venomous creatures abound. In a
collection of amulets belonging to Professor Joseph
Belucci, of Perugia, Italy, which was exhibited at the
Paris Exposition, 1891, were a number of perforated
stones and other objects used by Italians as charms
to protect the bearer against the bite of serpents and
reptiles.<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></p>

<h3>VIII. LEGAL PROSECUTION OF ANIMALS</h3>

<p>Legal proceedings were formerly instituted against
vermin, who were thus treated as if they were human
beings endowed with consciences and responsible for
their actions. Prosecutions of animals were common in
France and Switzerland, with a view to protect communities
from their depredations. Thus rats and mice,
and also bulls, oxen, cows, and mares; sheep, goats,
pigs, and dogs; moles, leeches, caterpillars, and various
reptiles, were liable to punishment by legal process.<a name="FNanchor_507" id="FNanchor_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a>
The Roman Catholic Church claimed full power to
anathematize all animate and inanimate things, founding
its authority on the Scriptural precedents of the
malediction pronounced on the serpent in the garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
of Eden, and the cursing of the barren fig-tree by our
Lord.<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> The belief in the moral responsibility of animals
was also thought to be warranted by the old
Mosaic law as declared in Genesis ix. 5:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the
hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of
man.</p>

</div>

<p>Also in Exodus xxi. 28:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the
ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten;
but the owner of the ox shall be quit.</p>

</div>

<p>In the Code of the Spartan lawgiver, Lycurgus, and
in that of the Athenian legislator, Draco, provision was
made for the formal trial of animals for misdemeanors.<a name="FNanchor_509" id="FNanchor_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>
A vestige of the unreasonable belief that brutes and
even inanimate objects were accountable for their actions
is to be found in that now obsolete term of English
law, <i>deodand</i>, meaning, according to Blackstone,
“a personal chattel which was the immediate cause of
the death of a rational creature, and for that reason
given to God; that is, forfeited to the Crown to be
applied to pious uses.” The <i>deodand</i> was of Grecian
ancestry, as appears from the ceremonies connected with
the offering of a sacrifice by the Athenians. When the
animal or victim had been dispatched by an axe in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
hands of the officiating priest, the latter immediately
fled, and to evade arrest he threw away the axe. This
instrument was then seized by his pursuers, and an
action entered against it. The advocate for the axe
pleaded that it was less guilty than the grinder who
sharpened it; the grinder laid the blame on the grindstone
which he had used; and thus the whole process
became a farce and a mockery of justice.<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></p>

<p>We learn from the writings of the Benedictine monk,
Leonard Vair, that in certain districts of Spain, in the
fifteenth century, when the inhabitants wished to drive
away grasshoppers or noxious vermin, they chose a
conjurer as judge and appointed counsel for the defendants,
with a prosecuting attorney, who demanded
justice in behalf of the aggrieved community. The
mischief-makers were finally declared guilty, and either
duly anathematized or formally excommunicated,<a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> the
technical distinction between the two sentences being
doubtless to them a matter of profound indifference.
At this period, also, prosecutions of pigs or sows guilty
of devouring young infants were not uncommon.</p>

<p>Barthélémy Chassaneux, a famous French advocate
of the sixteenth century, first won distinction by the
originality of his pleas in defense of some rats in a
notable trial at Autun. He represented to the judge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
that his clients found it extremely difficult to obey the
summons issued to them by the court, owing to their
being obliged to traverse a region abounding in cats,
who were, moreover, especially alert on account of the
notoriety of the legal proceedings.<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></p>

<p>Chassaneux wrote that the people of Autun had long
agitated the question how best to rid the province of
Burgundy of locusts, and he expressed the belief that
a sure method of accomplishing so desirable a result
was by the scrupulous payment of all tithes and ecclesiastical
dues, and by causing a woman to walk barefoot
round the infested fields.<a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a></p>

<p>After the seventeenth century, prosecutions of animals
and the use of incantations for their expulsion
became less common. The Ritual of Séez in 1743 forbade
such practices without the special permission of
the church, but the same volume contains a formula
for driving away grasshoppers, maybugs, and other insects.
Mr. C. G. Leland states, in his “Gypsy Sorcery,”
that exorcism has been vigorously applied in the United
States, not only against the Colorado beetle and army
worm, but also for the suppression of blizzards and the
grape disease. It has not had much success hitherto,
probably owing, as he naïvely remarks, to the uncongenial
climate.</p>

<h2 id="THE_LUCK_OF_ODD_NUMBERS">THE LUCK OF ODD NUMBERS</h2>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For there’s luck in odd numbers,” says Rory O’More.—<span class="smcap">Samuel Lover.</span></p>

</div>

<h3>I. EARLY SIGNIFICANCE OF NUMBERS</h3>

<p>In the “Cabala,” or ancient mystic philosophy of
the Jews, much importance is attributed to the combination
of certain numbers, letters, and words. According
to one tradition, the earliest Cabala was given
by the angel Raziel to Adam, and orally transmitted
through generations until the time of Solomon, by
whom it was first embodied in written form. Another
report alleges that the cabalistic secrets of nature were
received from God by Moses in the Mount, and afterwards
taught to Joshua, who communicated them to the
seventy elders, and they have since been treasured by
the initiated among the Jews.</p>

<p>According to the doctrine of the Pythagoreans, the
unit or monad was regarded as the father of Numbers,
while the duad, or two, was its mother; and thus is
explained one source of the general predilection for
odd numbers, the father being esteemed worthy of
greater honor than the mother, and the odd numbers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
being masculine, while the even numbers were feminine.
Moreover, the unit, being the origin of all numbers,
represented Divinity, as God was the creator and originator
of all things.<a name="FNanchor_514" id="FNanchor_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> It was also the symbol of Harmony
and Order, whereas the duad signified Confusion
and Disorder, and represented the Devil.</p>

<p>Plutarch remarks in his “Roman Questions” that
the beginning of number, or unity, is a divine thing;
whereas the first of the even numbers, Deuz or Deuce,
is directly opposite in character. As for the even
number, said this writer, it is defective, imperfect, and
indefinite; whereas the uneven or odd number is finite,
complete, and absolute.</p>

<p>The belief in the lucky significance of odd numbers
is of great antiquity, and reference to it is made by
Virgil in the eighth Eclogue, and by Pliny, who comments
on its prevalence in his time, but offers no explanation
therefor. The Roman king, Numa Pompilius,
is said to have added days to certain months in order
to make an odd number.</p>

<p>It is related, moreover, that the Emperor Julius Cæsar
(<span class="smcapuc">B. C.</span> 100-44), having once been thrown out of his
chariot through some mishap, refused thereafter to set
out upon a drive or journey until he had thrice repeated
a magic formula; and this practice appears to have
been commonly in vogue in those days.<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>The persistency of a traditional belief is exemplified
by the modern association of luck with uneven numbers;
and probably the Goddess Fortune herself preferred a
three-legged stool. However this may be, it is evident
that the legions of her worshipers to-day are firmly
convinced of the mystic charm inherent in triplets.
The Chinese pagodas, or sacred towers, built by devout
persons with the object of improving the luck of a
neighborhood, have always an odd number of stories,
being from three to thirteen floors high.<a name="FNanchor_516" id="FNanchor_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> In Siam,
also, this superstition holds universal sway, and its influence
in the construction of buildings is especially
noticeable; for the Siamese religiously adhere to odd
numbers in architecture, and every house must have
an uneven number of rooms, windows, and doors; each
staircase must have an uneven number of steps.<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a></p>

<p>In the early literature and mythology of the Northern
nations much importance was attached to the numbers
three and nine, which were held especially sacred and
dear to the gods. This fact is shown in their religious
ceremonies, and more particularly in their sacrifices,
which occurred every ninth month. Each sacrifice,
moreover, lasted nine days, and each day nine victims,
whether men or animals, were offered up.<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<h3>II. THE NUMBER THREE</h3>

<p>Three, as emblematic of the Trinity, has always been
considered a sacred number, and long before the Christian
era God was worshiped as a triple Deity. This is
true not only of the Assyrians, Phœnicians, Greeks, and
Romans, but also of the ancient Scandinavians, the
Druids, the inhabitants of Mexico and Peru, as well as
the Chinese and Japanese.</p>

<p>So from earliest times the Hindus have worshiped
their triad of Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva. In Holy Writ
we find three sister virtues, Faith, Hope, and Charity;
and in classic mythology are trios of Graces, Fates, and
Furies, the three-forked lightning of Jupiter, the three-headed
dog, Cerberus, and the trident of Neptune.
The tripod was anciently a symbol of prophecy and
of divine authority, and the triangle was originally the
pagan emblem of a holy triad.</p>

<p>The peculiar significance of the number three was
due partly to the fact of its being the first uneven
number containing an even one; and from the importance
formerly attributed to it may have originated the
familiar saying, “The third time never fails.”</p>

<p>In the several codes of ancient Welsh laws are numerous
so-called triads, of which the following are
curious examples:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Three things which a villain is not at liberty to sell without
permission of his lord; a horse, swine, and honey. Three
things not to be paid for though lost in a lodging-house; a
knife, a sword, and trousers. There are three animals whose
tails, eyes, and lives are of the same worth; a calf, a filly for
common worth, and a cat, excepting the cat that shall watch
the king’s barn.</p>

</div>

<p>Among the ancient Irish, also, considerable importance
was attached to the number three. Thus we read
that among the household officials of the High King
of Erin were three royal jugglers, three jesters, three
head charioteers, three equerries, three swineherds,
three janitors, and three drink-bearers.</p>

<p>Multiples of the mystic number three were much employed
by witches in their incantations, and they are
even now favorites with the Chinese, who have a saying
that one produced two and two produced three, while
three produced all things. This partiality is illustrated
in the dimensions of the Temple of Heaven in Pekin,
where three and nine constantly recur.</p>

<p>In a book entitled “Varieties,” by David Person
(London, 1635), being “a surveigh of rare and excellent
matters, necessary and delectable for all sorts of persons,”
the author comments at some length on the significance
of certain triads. Among others he mentions
three things incident to man,—to fall into sin, which
is human; to rise out of it again, which is angelical;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
and to lie in sin, which is diabolical. Again, three
powerful enemies, the world, the flesh, and the Devil,
which constantly assail man, should be opposed by
three efficient weapons, fasting, prayer, and almsgiving.
Thomas Vaughan, in his “Anthroposophia Theomagica,”
has much to say concerning the virtues of numbers.
“Every compound whatsoever,” he says, “is three
in one and one in three.” In speaking of a natural triplicity,
however, he does not wish to be understood as
referring to “kitchen-stuff, those three pet principles,
water, oil, and the earth, but to celestial hidden natures,
known only to absolute magicians.”</p>

<p>In Northumberland smooth holly leaves, gathered
late on a Friday, are collected in a three-cornered handkerchief
and carried home. Then nine of the leaves
are tied into a handkerchief with nine knots, and
placed under the would-be diviner’s pillow, and, as a
result, interesting revelations from dreamland are confidently
anticipated. In another magical ceremony, a
maiden before retiring sets three pails of water on
the floor of her bedroom, and pins three holly leaves
on her left breast. She will then, conformably to the
popular belief, be awakened from her first nap by three
loud yells, followed by three horse-laughs, whereupon
the form of her future husband will be revealed to her.<a name="FNanchor_519" id="FNanchor_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></p>

<p>The supposed efficacy of these rites doubtless depends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
chiefly upon the use of the magical holly, but
the repetition of odd numbers is also characteristic of
charms, incantations, and mystic procedures in all ages
and throughout the world.</p>

<h3>III. THE NUMBER SEVEN</h3>

<p>The number seven has ever been regarded as having
a peculiar mystic significance, and its manifold virtues
have been the theme of elaborate monographs. Alike
in Holy Writ and among the earliest historic peoples,
in classic antiquity and in the mythologies of many
nations, this number has been most prominent, and to
this fact may reasonably be attributed a portion of the
luck associated with odd numbers in general. A complete
enumeration of familiar examples of the use of
this favorite number, although germane to our subject,
would be beyond the scope of this sketch, but a few
instances may be appropriately given.</p>

<p>The origin of the respect accorded this number by
the nations of antiquity was probably astronomical, or
more properly astrological, and arose from their observation
of the seven great planets and of the lunar
phases, changing every seventh day.</p>

<p>It was a saying of Hippocrates that the number
seven, by reason of its mystic virtues, tended to the
accomplishment of all things, and was the dispenser of
life and the fountain of all its changes; for as the
moon changes its phases every seven days, so this
number influences all sublunary beings.<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> The phrase
“to be in the seventh heaven” was derived from the
seven planets, which were believed by the Babylonians
to be carried around upon as many globes of crystal,
the seventh being the highest.<a name="FNanchor_522" id="FNanchor_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> In the writings of the
Cabalists of old are likewise portrayed seven heavens,
one above another, and the seventh or highest was the
abode of God and the higher angels. The ultimate
source of the sanctity of the number seven has, however,
been ascribed to the <i lang="la">septentriones</i>, the seven
ploughing oxen, stars of the constellation of the Great
Bear.</p>

<p>An ingenious but not especially plausible reason
alleged for the popularity of this number is the
fact of its being composed of <em>three</em>, the number of
sides in a triangle, and <em>four</em>, the number of sides in
a square, thus representing two of the simplest geometric
figures.<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a></p>

<p>Certain Biblical critics of a speculative turn of mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
have concluded that its prominence as a symbol is due
to the emblematic significance of its component parts,
three and four; the former representing Divinity, and
the latter Humanity: in other words, “the union between
God and man, as affected by the manifestations
of the Divinity in creation and revelation.”<a name="FNanchor_524" id="FNanchor_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a></p>

<p>In some portions of a great work on magic, discovered
by Mr. A. H. Layard among fragments of clay
tablets in the ruins of a palace in ancient Nineveh, are
many incantations, formulæ, and conjurations, in which
the number seven occurs repeatedly.<a name="FNanchor_525" id="FNanchor_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a></p>

<p>As familiar instances of the prominence of this number
in former times may be cited the seven wise men
of Greece, the seven gates of Thebes, and the legend
of the seven sleepers of Ephesus.</p>

<p>Other examples are given in the following “seven
heroic verses” sent by a certain Mr. Michelburn to one
Mr. Crisp, who owed the former seven shillings:—</p>

<p>In ancient Ireland every well-to-do farmer had seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
prime possessions,—a house, a mill or a share in it, a
kiln, barn, sheep-pen, calf-house, and pigsty.</p>

<p>The number seven appears more than three hundred
times in the Scriptures. God created the world in six
days and rested on the seventh, and throughout the
Old Testament, as well as in the Apocalypse, the constant
recurrence of this sacred number is noteworthy.
Thus we read of the seven fat and seven lean kine of
Pharaoh’s dream, and also, in the account of the Fall of
Jericho (Joshua vi. 4): “And seven priests shall bear
before the ark seven trumpets of rams horns: and the
seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and
the priests shall blow with the trumpets.”</p>

<p>According to a popular mediæval tradition, Adam and
Eve remained but seven hours in Eden.</p>

<p>Seven archangels are mentioned in the Bible and in
Jewish writings,—<em>Michael</em>, who was the special guardian
and protector of the Jews, and in whose honor the
Festival of Michaelmas is celebrated on the twenty-ninth
day of September by the Anglican and Roman
Catholic churches; <em>Gabriel</em>, the messenger who appeared
to the Virgin Mary and to Zacharias; <em>Raphael</em>,
spoken of in the Book of Tobit as the companion and
guardian of Tobias, and conqueror of the demon
Asmodeus; <em>Uriel</em>, an angel mentioned in the Book of
Esdras; <em>Chamuel</em>, who, according to Jewish tradition,
wrestled with Jacob; <em>Jophiel</em>, who expelled Adam and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
Eve from Eden, and who was the guardian of the “tree
of the knowledge of good and evil;” and <em>Zadkiel</em>, the
angel who is supposed to have stayed the hand of
Abraham when the latter was about to sacrifice his
son Isaac.<a name="FNanchor_527" id="FNanchor_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

<p>Samson’s strength resided in seven locks of his hair,
representing the seven rays of Light, the source of
Strength. And the shearing of these seven locks by
Delilah, a woman of low character, has been described
as a triumph of Evil in suppressing Light.<a name="FNanchor_528" id="FNanchor_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a></p>

<p>According to Herodotus, the Arabs of the desert had
a peculiar method of confirming a vow of friendship.
Two men stood on either side of a third, who made incisions
with a sharp stone on the palms of their hands,
and, having dipped in the blood therefrom some portion
of a garment of each, he proceeded to moisten with it
seven stones lying on the ground.<a name="FNanchor_529" id="FNanchor_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a></p>

<p>The age of the world, in the opinion of learned
men of former times, was properly divided into seven
great epochs; namely, the <em>first</em>, from the creation of
Adam to the Deluge; <em>second</em>, from the latter event
to the time of Abraham; <em>third</em>, from Abraham to the
Exodus of the children of Israel; <em>fourth</em>, from that
time to the building of Solomon’s Temple; <em>fifth</em>, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
then to the Babylonish Captivity; <em>sixth</em>, the period between
that and the coming of our Lord; and <em>seventh</em>,
from the beginning of the Christian era to the end of
the world.</p>

<p>According to astrologers, man’s age was divided into
seven parts, governed by seven planets. The first
part, <em>Infancy</em>, comprised four years, and was ruled by
the Moon, a weak, moist, and changeable body. Next
came <em>Childhood</em>, a period of ten years governed by
Mercury, a planet indifferently good or bad, according
to the character of the planets with whom he was associated.
Following this came <em>Youthhead</em>, from fourteen
to twenty-two, over which Venus presided. Next was
<em>Adolescence</em>, lasting twenty years and ruled by the
Sun, and in this age man attained his full strength and
vigor. The fifth, from forty-two to fifty-six, was called
<em>Manhood</em>, and was under the dominion of Mars, a bad
star. At this time men began to wax angry, impatient,
and avaricious, but were more temperate in their diet,
and more discreet. The next period of twelve years
was called <em>Old Age</em>, governed by Jupiter, a noble
planet, whose influence rendered men religious, chaste,
and just. The seventh was <em>Decrepit Old Age</em>, ruled
by Saturn, and comprising the years from seventy-eight
to ninety-eight.<a name="FNanchor_530" id="FNanchor_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a></p>

<p>In the Lambeth Palace Library there is a manuscript<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
of the fifteenth century in which the seven canonical
hours are compared with the seven periods of human
life, as follows:—</p>

<p>In the “Secrets of Numbers,” by William Ingpen,
Gent. (London, 1624), the number seven is described as
the most excellent of all for several notable and curious
reasons, and prominent among these was the alleged
fact that the Soul consists of seven parts, namely, Acuminie,
Wit, Diligence, Counsel, Reason, Wisdom, and
Experience.</p>

<h3>IV. ODD NUMBERS IN WITCHCRAFT</h3>

<p>Odd numbers are intimately associated with the black
art, for witches’ incantations are commonly repeated
three or nine times. Who ever heard of a witch performing
any of her mystic rites exactly four or six
times? Apropos of this may be quoted the following
story, taken from the advance sheets of a work entitled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
“Golspie,” edited by Edward W. B. Nicholson, M. A.,
Bodley’s Librarian in the University of Oxford, England,
and loaned by him to the writer. The book contains
much interesting folk-lore of the extreme north of
Scotland:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A woman who lived near Golspie was always telling her
neighbors that a woman whom they all believed to be a
witch had cast an evil eye upon the cow and herself. “Her
milk and butter were spoiled,” she said; and she also told
them that in a dream she saw the witch in the shape of a hare
come into her milk-house and drink the milk. One day when
she was in the wood for sticks, her neighbors went into her
byre, and seeing a petticoat on a nail, cut a number of crosses
on it and put it in the cow’s stall. Then they tied nine rusty
nails to a cord with nine knots on it. This cord they tied to
the chain on the cow’s neck, and then went away. Shortly
after the woman came home, she went into the byre, and seeing
the petticoat, nails, etc., ran out to her neighbors screaming,
and calling to them to go and see what the witch had
done on her. To make sure that it was the witch’s work,
she showed them the <em>unequal number</em> of nails and knots.
Then she took everything that she thought the witch had
handled, and made a fire of them, saying that she could no
longer harm any person, because her power was destroyed
by fire.</p>

</div>

<p>The employment of odd numbers in magical formulæ
is exemplified in the following recipe for a drink against
all temptations of the Devil, used by the Saxons in
England:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Take betony, bishop wort, lupins, githrife, attorlothe, wolfscomb,
yarrow; lay them under the altar, sing nine masses
over them, scrape the worts into holy water, give the man to
drink at night, fasting, a cup-full, and put the holy water into
all the meat which the man taketh. Work thus a good salve
against the temptations of the fiend.<a name="FNanchor_532" id="FNanchor_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></p>

</div>

<p>A Hindu woman, on returning with her young child
from a strange village, is careful, before entering her
own dwelling, to pass seven small stones seven times
around the baby’s head, and throw them away in different
directions, in order thus to disperse any evil which
may have been contracted during her trip.<a name="FNanchor_533" id="FNanchor_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></p>

<p>And as a preliminary to other mystic procedures, in
order to avert the Evil Eye, the Hindus wave around
the patient’s face seven pebbles taken from a spot where
three roads meet, seven leaves of the date-palm, and
seven bunches of leaves of the <i>bor</i> tree.<a name="FNanchor_534" id="FNanchor_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> It may not
be surprising that such mysterious rites, whose efficacy
depends chiefly on the magical potency of certain odd
numbers, should be popular among the natives of
India, but it is noteworthy that these numbers are
equally influential in Christian lands. A multiplication
of examples might serve to emphasize this fact,
but would occupy too much space. Charms and formulas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
are commonly thrice repeated, probably in reference
to the Holy Trinity.</p>

<p>The Bavarian peasant, in passing through a haunted
place, considers himself amply fortified against evil if
he takes the precaution to carry three things; namely,
(1) a new knife which has never cut anything, marked
on the blade with three crosses; (2) a loaf of bread
baked on Epiphany Eve; (3) a black cat.<a name="FNanchor_536" id="FNanchor_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a></p>

<h3>V. ODD NUMBERS IN FOLK-MEDICINE</h3>

<p>In a volume containing a great variety of ancient
charms and magical cures, collected by Marcellus Empiricus,
a Latin writer of the fourth century <span class="smcapuc">A. D.</span>, in
which volume various remedial measures are described
with great minuteness, the even numbers seldom appear.
Thus, for the removal of a foreign substance from the
eye, one should rub the affected organ with the five
fingers of the hand of the same side, and repeat thrice
a charm of words. Again, for the cure of a sty on
the eyelid, take nine grains of barley and poke the sty
with each one separately, meanwhile repeating a magic
formula in Greek. Then throw away the nine and do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
the same with seven, throw away the seven and do the
same with five, and so with three and one.</p>

<p>The early Saxon physicians in England seem also to
have had faith in the peculiar virtues of the number
nine, as is evident from many of their prescriptions, of
which the following prefix to a lengthy Latin charm is
a fair specimen:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>For flying venom and every venomous swelling, on a Friday
churn butter which has been milked from a neat or hind
all of one colour, and let it not be mingled with water. Sing
over it nine times a litany and nine times the <cite>Paternoster</cite>,
and nine times this incantation.<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In an ancient English manuscript (Harleian Collection,
No. 585), frequent examples are given of the employment
of odd numbers in therapeutics. Thus, for dropsical
affections, a beverage containing alexander, betony,
and fennel is to be drunk daily for seven days. “To
expel venom,” centaury is to be taken for fifteen days,
and a potion prepared from the seed of cress is extolled
for its curative qualities if taken faithfully during
three days.<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a></p>

<p>Indeed, the odd numbers are prominent in the annals
of folk-medicine throughout Great Britain. The three
chief duties of a physician were declared to be as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
the restoration of health when lost, its amelioration
when weak, and its preservation when recovered.
So also three qualities were requisite in a surgeon;
namely, an eagle’s eye, a lion’s heart, and a lady’s
hand, attributes equally essential to the skillful operator
of the present day.</p>

<p>The natives of the Hebrides inherit the old Scandinavian
and Celtic partiality for certain odd numbers.
Thus in Tiree a favorite cure for jaundice consists in
wearing a shirt previously dipped in water taken from
the tops of nine waves, and in which nine stones have
been boiled. These same people formerly employed a
peculiar method of treating sick cattle. The veterinary,
holding in his hands a cup of cream and an oat-cake,
takes his seat upon the animal, and repeats a Celtic
charm of words “nine times nine times,” taking “a bit
and a sip” before each repetition.<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></p>

<p>In Cornwall, for the cure of inflammatory affections,
the invocation of three angels is thrice repeated to each
one of nine bramble leaves; and a popular remedy for
whooping cough is to pass a child nine times under and
over a three-year-old donkey.<a name="FNanchor_540" id="FNanchor_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> In the south of England,
for intermittent fever, the patient is recommended
to eat seven sage leaves on seven successive mornings,
fasting meanwhile; and in northern Scotland scrofulous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
affections are thought to yield to the touch of a
seventh son, when accompanied by an invocation of
the Trinity.<a name="FNanchor_541" id="FNanchor_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></p>

<p>The belief in the magical curative qualities of the
number nine was not limited to the northern nations.
Thus the inhabitant of ancient Apulia, when bitten by
a scorpion, proceeded to walk nine times around the
walls of his native town.</p>

<p>Dr. D. G. Brinton, in his “Nagualism, a Study of
Native American Folk-Lore and History,” remarks that
the number nine recurs very often in the conjurations
of Mexican magicians.</p>

<p>The women of Canton, China, attribute magical properties
for the cure of cutaneous affections to water
drawn after midnight of the seventh day of the seventh
month.</p>

<p>When a gypsy child bumps its head, a knife-blade is
first pressed upon the swelling, after which an incantation
is pronounced three, seven, or nine times, and the
knife is stuck into the earth a like number of times.
Many charms employed by gypsies could be mentioned
in illustration of the avoidance of even numbers in all
their mystic rites.<a name="FNanchor_542" id="FNanchor_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<h3>VI. THE NUMBER THIRTEEN</h3>

<p>In regard to the luck of odd numbers, the exception,
which is commonly supposed to prove the rule, is the
much maligned thirteen.</p>

<p>In the Scandinavian mythology Loki, the Principle
of Evil and the chief author of human misfortunes,
accompanied the twelve Æsir, or Demigods, and was
reckoned the thirteenth among them. Moreover, the
Valkyrs, or Virgins, who waited upon the heroes in
Valhalla, were thirteen in number, and from these
sources is believed to have sprung the very common
superstition concerning the ill luck and fatality of the
number thirteen, especially in connection with a party
of guests at table.</p>

<p>The most generally received explanation of the origin
of this popular belief refers it to the Last Supper of
our Lord, where Judas is sometimes represented as the
thirteenth guest. But why Judas rather than John,
the beloved disciple? However, this is the generally
accepted starting-point of this notable superstition.
As with the Jews the thirteenth month, and with the
Christians the thirteenth day of the year, which began
with Christmas, were accounted ominous, so, with the
inhabitants of India, the thirteenth year was considered
to be of evil import. It is evident, therefore, that the
source of this nearly world-wide belief cannot be attributed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
wholly either to the mythology of the north or
to the Paschal Supper.<a name="FNanchor_543" id="FNanchor_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a></p>

<p>When the year was reckoned as thirteen lunar
months of twenty-eight days each, the number thirteen,
according to one view, was considered auspicious; but
when, under the present method of solar time, the
number of months was reduced to twelve, thirteen’s
reputation was changed for the worse.<a name="FNanchor_544" id="FNanchor_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a></p>

<p>In early times the Feast of the Epiphany, which is
the thirteenth day after Christmas Eve, was feared
because at that time the three goddesses, Berchta,
Holle, and Befana, with their ghostly companions,
were especially active; and, as a guard against their
machinations, the initial letters of the names of the
three kings, or wise men, were written on many a door.</p>

<p>Of the former trio, Berchta was represented as a
shaggy monster, whose name was used as a bugbear with
which to frighten children. She was intrusted with the
oversight of spinning, and on the eve of Epiphany she
visited the homes of the countryfolk, distributing
empty reels, which she required to be filled within a
specified time; if her demands were not complied with,
she retaliated by tangling and befouling the flax.</p>

<p>Holle, or Holda, was a benignant and merciful goddess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
of an obliging disposition, who was usually most
lenient, except when she noticed disorder in the affairs
of a household. Her favorite resorts were the lakes
and fountains, but she had also an oversight over
domestic concerns, and shared with Berchta the supervision
of spinning. Sometimes, however, she appeared
as an old hag, with bristling, matted hair and long
teeth.</p>

<p>Befana, the third goddess, was of Italian origin, and
her name signifies Epiphany. On that day the women
and children used to place a rag doll in the window in
her honor. In personal appearance she was black and
ugly, but her disposition was not unfriendly.</p>

<p>So universal has been the superstition regarding the
number thirteen at table, that it has long been a matter
of etiquette in France to avoid having exactly that
number of guests at dinner-parties. The Parisian
<i lang="fr">pique-assiette</i>, a person whose title corresponds to the
English “trencher friend” or “sponger,” is also known
as a <i lang="fr">quatorzième</i>, his chief mission being to occupy the
fourteenth seat at a banquet.</p>

<p>The ancients, we learn, had ideas of their own regarding
the proper size of festive gatherings, their favorite
number of <i lang="fr">convives</i> being between three and nine, the
number of the Graces and Muses respectively.<a name="FNanchor_545" id="FNanchor_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a></p>

<p>Opinions have differed as to whether misfortune were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
likely to befall the whole company of thirteen persons
rash enough to dine together, or only the one leaving
the room first after the repast. All evil, however, was
supposed to be averted by the entire company rising to
their feet together. It has been wittily remarked that
the only occasion when thirteen plates at table should
cause disquietude is when the food is only sufficient
for twelve persons.</p>

<p>At the thirteenth annual dinner of that unique organization,
the Thirteen Club, held in New York city,
January 13, 1895, at 7.13 o’clock, <span class="smcapuc">P. M.</span>, the custodian
delivered an address in which were recounted the circumstances
of the club’s formation. So prevalent was
the apprehension of evil likely to result from the assembling
together of thirteen persons that, when at length
the requisite number were seated at table, it was found
desirable to lock the doors of the banquet-room, lest
some faint soul should retire abruptly.</p>

<p>Field-Marshal Lord Roberts, in his “Forty-One Years
in India” (vol. i. p. 24), mentions a circumstance occurring
in his own experience, which affords evidence, were
any needed, of the falsity of the superstition in question.
On New Year’s Day, <span class="smcapuc">A. D.</span> 1853, Lord Roberts
was one of a party of thirteen who dined together at a
staff-officers’ mess at Peshawer, on the Afghan frontier.
Eleven years later all these officers were alive, the
greater number having participated in the suppression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
of the great Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, during which
several of them were wounded.</p>

<p>In Italy shrewd theatrical managers have found it
expedient to change the number of Box 13 to 12<span class="smcapuc">A</span>, and
in many streets of Rome and Florence one may search
in vain for house-numbers between 12½ and 14. A
gentleman of the writer’s acquaintance, living in Washington,
D. C., sent a formal petition to the authorities
asking leave to change the number of his house, for
the sole reason that it contained the ominous figures.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the popular distrust of the number
thirteen among the villagers of the Department
of Ille-et-Villaine, France, may be cited the following
custom, which is in vogue in that district. Children
are there usually taught the art of knitting by devout
elderly women. The little ones are first seated in a
circle, and, to facilitate the work, on the completion
of the first round of knitting they are made to repeat
the following words: “<em>One</em>, the Father;” at the close
of the second round, “<em>Two</em>, the Son;” and so on, as
follows: “<em>Three</em>, the Holy Spirit; the <em>four</em> Evangelists;
the <em>five</em> wounds of our Lord; the <em>six</em> commandments
of the church; <em>seven</em> sacraments; <em>eight</em> beatitudes;
<em>nine</em> choirs of angels; <em>ten</em> commandments of
God; <em>eleven</em> thousand virgins; <em>twelve</em> apostles;” and
at the close of the <em>thirteenth</em> round, the children mention
the name of Judas.<a name="FNanchor_546" id="FNanchor_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>This remarkable and unreasonable prejudice against
an innocent number seems to pervade all classes and
communities. The possession of intelligence and culture
is no effective barrier against it. Arguments and
reasoning are alike vain. Even at this writing, an
evening journal records that at a recent meeting of
a newly elected board of aldermen in an enlightened
city of eastern Massachusetts, one of the members
objected to casting lots for seats because he did not
relish the idea of drawing number thirteen. However,
his scruples having been in a measure overcome, he was
much relieved to find that the number eleven, which
is both uneven and lucky, had fallen to his share.<a name="FNanchor_547" id="FNanchor_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a></p>

<p>Brand quotes as follows from Fuller’s “Mixt Contemplations”
(1660) in reference to this subject:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A covetous Courtier complained to King Edward the sixt
of Christ Colledge in Cambridge, that it was a superstitious
foundation, consisting of a Master and twelve Fellowes, in
imitation of Christ and His twelve Apostles. He advised the
King also to take away one or two Fellowships, so as to discompose
that superstitious number. “Oh, no!” said the
King, “I have a better way than that to mar their conceit;
I will add a thirteenth Fellowship unto them;” which he did
accordingly, and so it remaineth unto this day.</p>

</div>

<p>Persians regard the number thirteen as so unlucky
that they refrain from naming it. When they wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
to allude to this number, instead of mentioning the
proper term, they use words meaning “much more” or
“nothing.”<a name="FNanchor_548" id="FNanchor_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a></p>

<p>The Moors, or Arabs, of northern Africa have similar
prejudices, whereas the American negro, ordinarily a
most credulous being, appears to be quite indifferent
to the evil influences of the fateful number;<a name="FNanchor_549" id="FNanchor_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> but in
Turkey, so great is the popular dislike of it that the
word for thirteen is seldom used.<a name="FNanchor_550" id="FNanchor_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a></p>

<p>In Scotland this number is known as the “Deil’s
Dozen,” a phrase which has been supposed to have
some connection with card-playing, there being thirteen
cards in each suit of the “Deil’s Books.” John
Jamieson, in his Scottish Dictionary, avows his inability
to trace the superstition to its source, but believes
that it includes the idea of the thirteenth being the
Devil’s lot. The number thirteen is also sometimes
known as a “baker’s dozen,” because it was formerly
a common practice to give thirteen loaves for twelve,
the extra piece being called the <em>in-bread</em> or <em>to-bread</em>.
This custom is supposed to have originated at a time
when heavy fines were imposed for short weights, the
additional bread being given by bakers as a precautionary
measure.<a name="FNanchor_551" id="FNanchor_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>In certain cases, contrary to the general rule, thirteen
is accounted a fortunate numeral, or even as one
possessing extraordinary virtues.</p>

<p>Dr. Daniel G. Brinton, in “A Primer of Mayan
Hieroglyphics” (p. 25), says that in the old language
of the Mayas, an aboriginal tribe of Yucatan, the
numbers nine and thirteen were used to denote indefinite
greatness and supreme excellence. Thus a very fortunate
man was possessed of nine souls, and the phrase,
“thirteen generations old,” conveyed the idea of perpetuity.
The “Demon with thirteen powers” was a
prominent figure in the mythology of the Tzentals, a
Mayan tribe.</p>

<p>According to a widely prevalent popular impression,
a brood is usually odd in number, and therefore it is
folly to set an even number of eggs under a hen. In
spite of the falsity of this idea, it is still quite customary
to set thirteen eggs, an even number in this case
being accounted unlucky.</p>

<p>Gerald Massey, in “The Natural Genesis,” remarks
that “there were thirteen kinds of spices set out in the
Jewish religious service, along with the zodiacal number
of twelve loaves of shew-bread. There are thirteen
articles to the Hebrew faith, and the Cabalists
have thirteen rules by which they are enabled to penetrate
the mysteries of the Hebrew Scriptures. Thirteen
are the dialectical canons of the Talmudical doctors for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
determining the sense of the law in all civil and ecclesiastical
cases.”</p>

<p>In England the day of twenty-four hours was formerly
divided into thirteen parts, as follows:—</p>

<table summary="Division of the day into parts">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">1.</td>
    <td>After midnight.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">2.</td>
    <td>Cock-crow.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">3.</td>
    <td>Between the first cock-crow and daybreak.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">4.</td>
    <td>The dawn.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">5.</td>
    <td>Morning.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">6.</td>
    <td>Noon.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">7.</td>
    <td>Afternoon.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">8.</td>
    <td>Sunset.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">9.</td>
    <td>Twilight.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">10.</td>
    <td>Evening.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">11.</td>
    <td>Candle-time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">12.</td>
    <td>Bed-time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">13.</td>
    <td>Dead of night.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Recurring now to the prevalent notions regarding
the sinister and portentous character of this number,
one may well inquire in all seriousness whether the
harboring of this and other firmly rooted superstitious
fancies is compatible with a deep and abiding Christian
faith. The answer is plainly in the negative. Therefore
it is doubtless true—and the truth should make us
free—that the greater our indifference to the various
alleged omens and auguries which so easily beset us,
the more readily shall we acquire and retain a firm and
enduring dependence on Divine Providence.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given

not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
